"The bad news is that Tina Fey and Amy Poehler aren't hosting the Golden Globes any more - their Bill Cosby material last time around was magnificently fearless and pertinent - and they're moreover not booked in to do the Oscars. The good news is that they have this tremendously funny mainstream comedy out now: a cracking crowdpleaser, also featuring some repertory players from Fey's TV gem 30 Rock, written by SNL regular Paula Pell and directed by Jason Moore, who gave us Pitch Perfect. It's what critics rather airily call an ""audience movie"": that is, a movie liable to be enjoyed chiefly by that absurdly unqualified demographic group - the audience. Like many such films, it does need the chemical reaction of a real-life crowd in the auditorium. Sisters is the kind of broad feelgood comedy that's made to look easy by Poehler and Fey, who breeze through the funny test and the Bechdel test and show that the female-female dynamic, so recently considered almost gravitationally impossible in comedy, works very well. Fey and Poehler get laughs with the smart, incorrect dialogue, their timing, the easy swing of their relationship, their ingrained song'n'dance relish for the material. They are masters of what the battle-hardened TV producer in the Peter O'Toole film My Favorite Year calls ""professional show-business comedy"". Fey and Poehler play two sisters, Kate and Maura, who have reached a state of anxiety in their lives. Kate is the party animal and single mom of exasperated teen daughter Hayley (Madison Davenport); she makes a precarious living doing people's hair, but after a disagreement with her employer she is now plying her trade freelance in the bathroom of the friend's apartment in which she is now crashing, using hair-dye materials that may not be entirely safe. Maura, on the other hand, is a nurse, a sobersides, a do-gooding community-minded person and the non-drinking ""designated mom"" at parties. The casting reverses the typecasting polarity you might expect of Fey and Poehler: it's pretty much the opposite of how they played in their film Baby Mama. But Pell's screenplay shows that despite being so different and having actually defined themselves in opposition to each other since their teenage years, these characters have an awful lot in common: loneliness and incipient melancholy. This is triggered when their elderly parents, played by James Brolin and Dianne Wiest, astonish them by announcing that they are selling the family home where they grew up, and downshifting to a retirement apartment to enjoy an easier and more affluent lifestyle. They are in fact unsentimentally impatient with their middle-aged children and are in the habit of ""fake-freezing"" on Skype to terminate long-distance calls. The daughters are brusquely informed they have just this weekend to take their teen mementos away before it all goes out with the trash. Pell's movie shows that this is not simply a matter of a few odds and ends: horrifyingly, the women's bedrooms are kept, shrine-like, exactly as they were when they were"
