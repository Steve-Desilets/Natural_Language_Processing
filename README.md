# Natural_Language_Processing
This repository contains Python code from my coursework in the Natural Language Processing course (MSDS 453) at Northwestern University. 
The projects cover a range of NLP topics, including data wrangling, feature extraction, topic modeling, classification, ontologies, context-aware text analysis, knowledge graphs, deep learning (LSTM) models, and chatbot creation.
