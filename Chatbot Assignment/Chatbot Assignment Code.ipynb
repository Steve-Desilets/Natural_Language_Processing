      "What fish can electrocute you?\n",
      " as with all fish, coral reef fish harbour parasites.\n",
      "What species can sting you?\n",
      " in return, the anemones provide the clownfish protection from their predators, who are not immune to anemone stings.\n",
      "What species are venomous?\n",
      " the most venomous known fish is the reef stonefish.\n",
      "What species are parasitic?\n",
      " parasites of coral reef fish include nematodes, platyhelminthes (cestodes, digeneans, and monogeneans), leeches, parasitic crustaceans such as isopods and copepods, and various microorganisms such as myxosporidia and microsporidia.\n",
      "What species are known for attacking scuba divers?\n",
      " lionfish can aggressively dart at scuba divers and attempt to puncture the facemask with their venomous spines.\n",
      "What are common herbivorous fish?\n",
      " sea anemones are common on reefs.\n",
      "Why do fish camouflage themselves?\n",
      " sometimes they camouflage the fish when the fish rests in places with the right background.\n",
      "How do fish get rid of their parasites?\n",
      " as with all fish, coral reef fish harbour parasites.\n",
      "What species have mutualistic relationships?\n",
      " there is a mutualistic relationship between sea anemones and clownfish.\n",
      "What species have commensalistic relationships?\n",
      " the relationship can be mutualistic, when both species benefit from the relationship, commensalistic, when one species benefits and the other is unaffected, and parasitistic, when one species benefits, and the other is harmed.\n",
      "Where in the world are coral reefs found?\n",
      " coral reefs contain the most diverse fish assemblages to be found anywhere on earth, with perhaps as many as 6,000â€“8,000 species dwelling within coral reef ecosystems of the world's oceans.\n",
      "What species engage in schooling?\n",
      " they have evolved to find protection by schooling, sometimes with other species like shoaling rabbitfish.\n",
