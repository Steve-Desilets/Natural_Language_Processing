101,SAR_Doc1_Covenant,SAR_Doc1_Covenant,SAR,Action,Negative,Covenant,"Nearly two years after the American military withdrew from Afghanistan, ending the longest war in U.S. history, it should come as no surprise that filmmakers are starting to look back and ask, ""What just happened?"" That's what artists do, after all. They examine the world around them. That Guy Ritchie is one of them in this case, however - that might be a surprise. Heretofore, Ritchie has for the most part been one of the fun ones, building his name on stylish action, well-timed one-liners and heavier-than-a-lead-zeppelin British accents. Substance? Nah, guv. No need. But in his latest, the war drama ""The Covenant,"" starring Jake Gyllenhaal and set during the war in Afghanistan, he's got something to say. This is serious Guy Ritchie. This is thoughtful Guy Ritchie. This is earnest Guy Ritchie. If only profound Guy Ritchie had come along for the trip, we might be onto something special. Instead, we get a capably made but simple-minded rescue film, one with a big heart - even if it could have used more brain. Like his movie, Ritchie's message is straightforward though honorable: Real men live up to their commitments. By extension, his film argues, countries should do the same. At the heart of things, in this case, are the promises made to the small army of interpreters in Afghanistan who aided the U.S. military during its two decades there. In exchange for their service, many were promised travel visas for their families - and then unceremoniously left behind when the war so abruptly ended. For storytelling purposes, ""The Covenant"" - on which Ritchie shares writing credit with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies - focuses on U.S. Army Sgt. John Kinley, played by Gyllenhaal. He leads a squad of soldiers tasked with finding and destroying Taliban bomb factories. It's dangerous work, as we learn early on in a scene that leaves Kinley's small squad in need of a new interpreter. Enter Ahmed (Dar Salim), who is far more than your garden-variety interpreter. He has skills, this Ahmed. He also has a very personal motivation for helping the Americans. It's an undeniably compelling story, although it should be noted it's also a fictional one. Ritchie's film pretends very, very hard to be based on actual events. It is not, although it was inspired by the plight of many Afghan interpreters left behind in the U.S. withdrawal. Those stories are well worth sharing. ""The Covenant"" can be criticized for a number of things, but there's no questioning its noble heart. Like Gyllenhaal's Sgt. Kinley, Salim's Ahmed is the strong, silent type, the kind of guy who exudes confidence and capability. They drink their coffee black, these guys. They grunt. They are warriors. These are the kind of men whose highest compliment to one another is a solemn exchange of knowing nods, in silent recognition of each other's towering manliness. But before they get there, they first must learn to trust one another, which is the central purpose of the first hour of"
102,SAR_Doc2_Covenant,SAR_Doc2_Covenant,SAR,Action,Negative,Covenant,"Have Guy Ritchie and Jake Gyllenhaal switched places with Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg? Maybe that could explain Ritchie and Gyllenhaal's new film The Covenant, a grim, plodding tribute to American military heroism that plays like one of Berg and Wahlberg's true-life patriotism dramas. Although it tells a fictional story, The Covenant recalls fact-based movies like Berg's Lone Survivor and Clint Eastwood's American Sniper, complete with onscreen text of statistics and photos of real people shown during the closing credits. Releasing a little over a month after Ritchie's last movie, Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre, The Covenant is the opposite of that quippy, globe-trotting spy adventure, almost entirely devoid of humor or cleverness. Instead, it's a slow, straight-faced military drama set in the later years of the American war in Afghanistan. Gyllenhaal plays Sgt. John Kinley, whose unit is tasked with locating and neutralizing sites where the Taliban is manufacturing or stockpiling weapons. After an attack at a checkpoint leaves the unit's interpreter dead, Kinley selects Afghan local Ahmed (Dar Salim) as a replacement, and Ahmed quickly proves to be a shrewd and loyal member of the team. That loyalty is put to the test during an ambush at a Taliban compound, which leaves Kinley and Ahmed as the only two survivors. Cut off from communications and transportation, with Taliban fighters in pursuit, Ahmed carries the wounded Kinley dozens of miles across the desert to safety, at great risk to himself. Although Ritchie spends the first half of the movie with Kinley, Ahmed and their fellow soldiers, there's little sense of camaraderie or personal connection, so Ahmed's extreme dedication to Kinley lacks emotional resonance. There are some rudimentary family bonding scenes between Ahmed and Kinley and their respective wives, but otherwise they're more archetypes than fully formed characters. Social commentary has never been one of Ritchie's strengths, and in The Covenant he tries to have it both ways, criticizing the U.S. government for its broken promises to Afghan military interpreters while holding up individual American soldiers and commanding officers as self-sacrificing heroes. Both Kinley and Ahmed are so noble and diligent that they're practically saints, although both actors attempt to portray the internal anguish the characters carry back from the battlefield. After he's rescued, Kinley returns home to California, but Ahmed has to go into hiding with his family, and Kinley vows to do anything he can to bring them safely to the U.S. In its final third, The Covenant goes full-on Rambo, when Kinley returns to Afghanistan as a one-man army, determined to pay his debt to the man who saved his life. This is more a story of obligation than friendship, and tacking on the dictionary definition of ""covenant"" at the end isn't enough to create a convincing brotherhood between the two men. Gyllenhaal delivers overwrought speeches about duty and honor, but it all rings hollow. At the same time, Ritchie remains an excellent director of action, and when he focuses on shootouts and chases, he delivers a"
103,SAR_Doc3_Covenant,SAR_Doc3_Covenant,SAR,Action,Negative,Covenant,"Guy Ritchie's The Covenant notably marks the first feature that has included the eponymous filmmaker's name in the title itself, a rather curious development as the film is the least Guy Ritchie-esque movie in his entire filmography. Indeed, the final product plays more like the director's attempt at aping the style of Peter Berg, a slab of right-wing militaristic propaganda that manages the miracle of making Lone Survivor look subtle in comparison. Perhaps an even more stunning discovery is that The Covenant is entirely a work of fiction, its far-flung story of the brotherhood's bonds forged in the hells of combat so relentlessly cliched that it seemed all but a lock for based-on-a-true-story status. That makes the script, courtesy of Ritchie and co-writers Marn Davies and Ivan Atkinson, nearly impossible to forgive in both its mind-numbing predictability and - to be quite frank - outright stupidity. Jake Gyllenhaal, in pure paycheck mode, stars as John Kinley, a Sergeant Major of the American Army who, in the year 2018, is stationed in Afghanistan, where he and the various members of his troop are hunting down Taliban-deployed IEDs. The various soldiers under Kinley's command are introduced with on-screen text, and in such quick succession that it is all but impossible to make heads-or-tails of who is who. Not that Ritchie is remotely interested in these men, as most aren't even afforded a single character trait - although, in fairness, one of them does like to eat and talk about food. Entering this tight-knit group is Ahmed (Dar Salim), a no-nonsense Afghani interpreter with whom Kinley forms an eventual bond because they are both stubborn and, damn it, they have to respect that in one another. But a raid on an IED manufacturing plant soon leaves the entire troop dead, save for Kinley and Ahmed, who must travel by foot over treacherous terrain to reach base as they are relentlessly hunted by the Taliban. It's at the halfway point in the film that Kinley becomes injured to the point of catatonia, with Ahmed dragging - and, with the eventual aid of a wagon, wheeling - Kinley's lifeless body over 50 miles to safety, an impossible feat that the film devotes less than fifteen minutes to detailing, opting for a series of montages (set to a bombastic and ultimately oppressive score courtesy of Christopher Benstead) that robs the movie of anything resembling tension while also completely neutering Ahmed's Herculean task. Cut ahead seven weeks, and Kinley discovers from the safety of his home in California that Ahmed is #1 Most Wanted on the Taliban's kill list, a fact that has forced the interpreter, along with his wife and newborn baby, into hiding. The remainder of The Covenant focuses on Kinley's attempts to locate Ahmed and his family and secure their safe passage to America, with Sergeant Major ultimately traveling to Afghanistan once more in the name of brotherhood, because, of course.The film's first hour is certainly no great shakes, but it feels like a"
104,SAR_Doc4_Covenant,SAR_Doc4_Covenant,SAR,Action,Negative,Covenant,"In a weird throwback to those Chuck Norris ""Missing in Action "" films of the 1980s, ""Guy Ritchie's The Covenant,"" a far better-made effort, is yet another war movie that asks us to feel good about something we should feel bad about. In this case, it is the way that the United States has treated Afghan interpreters and their families, who are now at great risk because visas promised to them have not been made available as promised, and the Afghans and their families are at great risk from the resurgent Taliban. While we were able to drive the Taliban back, the Afghan forces can't fight the insurgents alone. Our chaotic withdrawal made matters worse. In fact, there was a recent story in the news headlined ""Afghans Stranded in Pakistan Are Struggling After Broken Promises from the U.S."" How do we compare this reality with the content of ""The Covenant,"" a film about the heroic Sgt. John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal), an experienced and highly-trained fighter in Afghanistan in 2018 with a loving wife (Emily Beecham) and two small children back home. After the death of his previous interpreter in an I.E.D. explosion, John carefully acquires a new one named Ahmed (the imposing and impressive Iraqi actor Dar Salim, ""Game of Thrones""). Ahmed has a beautiful, young and pregnant wife named Basira (Fariba Sheikhan), whom the Taliban threaten to ""feed to the dogs."" Ahmed is not good at taking orders, thinks he knows more about fighting than John and his soldiers (he might) and he hates the Taliban because they killed his son. In order to avoid making ""The Covenant"" look like a blatant ""white savior drama,"" screenwriters Ivan Atkinson (""The Gentlemen""), Marn Davies (""Wrath of Man"") and Ritchie (""Operation Fortune: Ruse De Guerre""), not exactly men known for writing realistic war movies, set ""The Covenant"" up as a tale about how Kinley owes such as astronomical debt to Ahmed for Ahmed's superhuman rescue of the wounded Kinley in the wild, that he could never pay that debt back entirely. Thus, the first two thirds of the film set up that enormous debt. After a disastrous attack on Kinley's squad, which seeks out I.E.D. factories in the vast, rocky Afghan wild (the film was shot in Alicante, Spain) and the wounding of Kinley, Ahmed and Kinley are hunted by faceless warlords who want them captured alive. Ahmed essentially carries Kinley over the Afghan mountains on a wooden sledge at great risk to them both. To ease the agony of his wounds, John will even smoke opium. In the final rescue fight, Ritchie cannot resist having a cocky American mercenary order a ""Spectre Gunship"" to demonstrate the blowing-bodies-to-bits superiority of American firepower, a sour gesture. Captions used at the end of ""The Covenant"" tell us of the dire plight of ""thousands"" of remaining interpreters and leave the impression for the gullible that the feel-good story we just watched is true. It is not. The faces you see in photos of real-life interpreters"
105,SAR_Doc5_Covenant,SAR_Doc5_Covenant,SAR,Action,Negative,Covenant,"It's a little odd that Guy Ritchie's name comes before the title in ""Guy Ritchie's The Covenant,"" given that it's the least Guy Ritchie film that Guy Ritchie (""Snatch,"" ""Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre"") has ever made. No quippy dialogue, no convoluted storytelling, no jokey violence. ""The Covenant"" is a lean and efficient war movie. Maybe a little too lean and efficient. While the battle scenes are effective and visceral, I yearned for the dialogue to have a little more of the color and life that Ritchie's known for. Most of the movie sounds like someone entered ""Write a war movie"" into ChatGPT. ""Guy Ritchie's The Covenant"" opens Friday at Marcus Point, Marcus Palace, AMC Fitchburg 18 and Flix Brewhouse Madison. Sgt. John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal) is on his fourth tour of duty in Afghanistan, leading a squad tasked with the often fruitless job of finding Taliban munitions. When his interpreter is killed, he's assigned a new one, Ahmed (Dar Salim). Ahmed lost a son to the Taliban, and he turns out to be as much of a tough guy as the U.S. soldiers he rides with. He's also a canny operator who understands the underground network of the Taliban better than the soldiers do, and acts as much as a human lie detector for Kinley as a translator. Ahmed's efforts help Kinley's squad avoid an ambush, and leads them to a big weapons cache in an abandoned mine 120 miles from the American base. The Taliban strike back, leading to a brutally exciting multi-front battle sequence in which Ritchie uses drone cameras and strong editing to keep the viewer aware of exactly where each combatant is in the battle. It's top-level action filmmaking. Kinley's unit is overrun by the Taliban, and only Kinley and Ahmed escape, hunted through the desert as they try to make the long journey back to base. This is the best sequence in the film, in part because it is almost dialogue-free. The communication using hand signals and facial expressions in the movie is more dramatically satisfying than the actual dialogue. Kinley is seriously injured, but Ahmed manages to drag him to safety. You'd think this journey would be enough for a movie, but ""The Covenant"" has another act to follow. When the wounded Kinley returns to America, he learns that the U.S. government has reneged on its promise to provide visas for Ahmed and his family. So Kinley resolves to go back to Afghanistan, alone if necessary, to bring him home. ""The Covenant"" is not based on a true story, but it is inspired by the actual plight of many Afghan interpreters who were abandoned by the U.S. after the Taliban seized control. Ritchie is clearly filled with righteous fury at the treatment of interpreters like Ahmed (over 300 interpreters have been murdered by the Taliban, we're told in the film), and that anger motivates and elevates ""The Covenant"" above the typical action movie. I just wish I had seen a little more of"
106,SAR_Doc6_Covenant,SAR_Doc6_Covenant,SAR,Action,Positive,Covenant,"""Guy Ritchie's The Covenant"" offers an overly simplistic portrayal of an American rescue mission in Afghanistan. However, this action flick has solid performances and capably shows the importance of interpreters during war. The movie is a mixed bag of questionable scenarios that look very fabricated for a movie and realistic depictions of the emotions and motivations for these actions. Guy Ritchie tends to write and direct action movies that have a lot of wisecracking banter among the characters. Compared to those other films, ""Guy Ritchie's The Covenant"" is a departure for him, since it's a deadly serious film that is inspired by harrowing situations from the 2001 to 2021 war that the U.S. waged in Afghanistan. (The movie, which takes place in 2018, was actually filmed in Spain.) In addition to directing ""Guy Ritchie's The Covenant"" and being one of the movie's producers, Ritchie co-wrote the screenplay with Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies. The rescue mission part of the story doesn't happen until the last third of the movie. Until then, viewers get to know the two central characters when the movie shows how these two men bonded during the horrors of war. John Kinley (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), who is American, is a master sergeant for the U.S. Army. Ahmed Abdullah (played by Dar Salim), who is Afghan, currently works as an interpreter for the U.S. military. Other things about Ahmed's background are eventually revealed and cause people to trust or mistrust Ahmed. John and Ahmed are both in their 40s and happily married to loyal wives. The beginning of ""Guy Ritchie's The Covenant"" takes place in Afghanistan, where John is leading a squad of staff sergeants who are tasked with finding explosives from the Taliban. It's a tight-knit unit that has overall good camaraderie. The members of this specialist unit under John's leadership are Joshua ""JJ"" Jung (played by Jason Wong); Tom ""Tom Cat"" Hancock (played by Rhys Yates); Eduardo ""Chow Chow"" Lopez (played by Christian Ochoa); Charlie ""Jizzy"" Crow (played by Sean Sagar); and Jack ""Jack Jack"" Jackson (played by James Nelson Joyce); and Steve Kersher (played by Bobby Schofield), the youngest sergeant in the group. Because this is a brutal war, not everyone will make it out alive. The unit has an interpreter named Kalan (played by Walid Shahalami), who is killed by a hidden bomb. John chooses Ahmed from a group of local interpreters to replace Kalan. John hired Ahmed without knowing much about him, except that Ahmed can speak four langauges, and Ahmed needs the money for this interpreter job. Ahmed also has a brother named Ali (played by Damon Zolfaghari), who has a pivotal role in the story. There are the predictable clashes between Ahmed (who has a tendency to defy John's orders) and John (who has a tendency to not trust Ahmed's information over the U.S. military's intel), but Ahmed and John eventually learn to trust each other. Later, it's revealed that Ahmed decided to help the U.S. government out of revenge"
107,SAR_Doc7_Covenant,SAR_Doc7_Covenant,SAR,Action,Positive ,Covenant,"Guy Ritchie's The Covenant is a welcome change of pace for the director. While Ritchie is well-known for embracing a cheeky sense of humour in many of his action movies (most recently in Operation Fortune: Ruse du Guerre), this one is more along the lines of his earlier Wrath of Man, eschewing any sense of levity to tell a profoundly affecting war story. While the premise may make it sound like a buddy movie, Ritchie takes the story in unexpected directions, broken down into a solid three-act structure that gives both leads, Gyllenhaal and Salim, time to anchor their own part of the story. Thus, it's more of a classic two-hander, with the two having a relationship that's born out of necessity rather than warmth, which doesn't belong in a film like this. Jake Gyllenhaal is terrific in a more-action driven part than usual, playing a U.S. sergeant named Kinley. He's a veteran soldier who leads a tight crew, and a violent Taliban attack has left his interpreter dead, forcing him to take on a new man, Dar Salim's Ahmed, who no one really trusts. Ahmed, with his cynical attitude and a shady history involving the heroin trade, initially seems like a tough character, but what Ritchie does so well in The Covenant is that he fleshes out Ahmed's story just as much as he does Kinley's. Yes, we know that Kinley has a family back home waiting for him, but so does Ahmed. He's joined the Army to seek vengeance on the Taliban, who killed his son, and we see that Salim's Ahmed is a badass in his own right. When he and Kinley are ambushed, he has the resourcefulness and skills to rescue his badly wounded sergeant, which is a daring movie by Ritchie as Gyllenhaal is sidelined for much of the second act. This pays off as, thanks to the increased focus on Ahmed, we really invest in his survival, making Kinley's return to rescue him all the more affecting when it happens. Again, neither Gyllenhaal nor Salim plays their roles in a melodramatic way. They two aren't buddies, but they respect each other. You recognize that Gyllenhaal has a debt to fulfil, and the film's final act is a nail-biter, with the two going up against impossible odds to survive. Gyllenhaal and Salim play well off each other, with the latter a real find. A veteran of many Danish films, including the excellent A Hijacking, he's a leading man in his own right and commands the screen when he takes over in the middle chunk of the film. By contrast, Gyllenhaal delivers a much subtler performance than usual. Kinley is a tough professional with a solid moral code, and Gyllenhaal delivers a more sympathetic, or rather heroic, performance in The Covenant than we've seen since probably Stronger. The supporting cast is solid too, with Jonny Lee Miller convincingly cast against type as U.S Army brass (he's been underappreciated for years). At the same time, The Boys"
108,SAR_Doc8_Covenant,SAR_Doc8_Covenant,SAR,Action,Positive ,Covenant,"I'm not sure why director Guy Ritchie has his name in the title of his latest film, but because this is I think the best Ritchie movie I have seen, I will pass up the chance to snark at the only misstep in Guy Ritchie's The Covenant. It about as exciting, gripping and moving as war films get - especially one set in the murky Afghanistan conflict in which the U.S. found itself immersed for more than two decades. This smartly focuses on two men, the apparently iconic U.S. Army Sgt. John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his Afghan interpreter Ahmed (Dar Salim). And no, this is not based on real people, at least not by name, but rather is a fictional account of what many involved in that war went through, and in the case of the interpreters, still are going through (the film's end credits state that many interpreters left behind have been murdered by the Taliban or gone into hiding since the U.S. left). In order to get these very necessary people to work with the Americans, they were promised visas for them and their families to start a new life afterward in the United States, but it was a bureaucratic nightmare, and promises made were not always promises kept. Kinley meets his new interpreter Ahmed after the previous one for his platoon was killed in action. It is a bit of a cat-and-mouse game between them right from the initial interview, but in reality they have much in common familywise, as we learn along the way. Ahmed's son was murdered by the Taliban, and his wife is pregnant. He has reason to turn on the Taliban with the idea he will get to leave them and country behind for a new life. Kinley, meanwhile, FaceTimes with his wife Caroline (Emily Beecham) and two young kids hoping to get home after the latest tour of duty. The first 45 minutes or so finds the pair on the hunt for IEDs, door-to-door in dangerous situations, with Ahmed key to getting valuable information and clearly helping as things get intense on the battlefield. Eventually the two are on the run together - and go straight into an ambush, where Kinley is nearly fatally wounded, barely conscious. Ahmed remarkably finds ways to keep him alive while on foot, dragging him on a stretcher across the country to safety. The film gets highly emotional, particularly for Kinley, who now has returned home, recovering from near death and only knowing the way he is still alive is solely due to Ahmed. And he has gone into hiding in Afghanistan, the promise made for visas never fulfilled. For Kinley, it becomes a new war to do everything humanly possible, and impossible, to find Ahmed and make things right. When the bureaucracy fails him, Kinley takes it upon himself to return and, in disguise, locate Ahmed and get him to America. Gyllenhaal is at his best in this kind of role and is able to"
109,SAR_Doc9_Covenant,SAR_Doc9_Covenant,SAR,Action,Positive ,Covenant,"When the US army withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, it abandoned hundreds of Afghan interpreters who had risked their lives working against the Taliban. Instead of getting visas to relocate to the US, as they had been promised, at least 300 interpreters were killed by Taliban forces. This grim framework might not seem the most obvious inspiration for a Guy Ritchie film, but Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels this ain't. The specific story Ritchie tells is fictional, but fairly plausible: Sergeant John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal) is working with interpreter Ahmed (Dar Salim), deep in Taliban-controlled land, when Kinley is injured. Somehow, Ahmed manages to transport him, by hook or by crook, 100 clicks back to safety. Will he be handsomely rewarded for his efforts? That would be a spoiler. Ritchie does well to keep things feeling tense. Cinema isn't always the best medium for showcasing endurance challenges; stamina is perhaps the virtue most difficult to dramatise on screen. While the sheer distance, temperatures and physical challenges faced by Ahmed are impressive, it's obviously all going to feel much more tense in the moments when he encounters Taliban search parties and gets to slip into more standard spy/action movie mode. Similarly, Gyllenhaal's challenge is to get us invested in the value of persistence in the face of indifference - not exactly the stuff of which Mission: Impossible movies are made. But Jake Gyllenhaal is not a preening leading man, and thank goodness - because you need a Gyllenhaal for this kind of role. Not every actor would be comfortable in a job which requires him to spend a significant stretch of his screentime semi-conscious in a makeshift wagon. And when the time comes for Kinley to spring into action, much of that action involves getting incredibly cross on the telephone after being put on hold for hours by impenetrable, baroque layers of US bureaucracy. That's not the sort of heroism that's going to work for every A-lister: they're going to be on the phone to their agent asking if they could be doing more scenes where they run towards an explosion in slow motion to save a child. Luckily, Gyllenhaal has almost made a speciality out of playing these kinds of more realistic protagonists: Anthony Swofford, the sniper who doesn't once fire his rifle in Jarhead. Tommy, the guy who nearly has an affair with his brother's wife, but then doesn't, in Brothers. That energy is perfect for the relatively sober-minded The Covenant - and allows space for Dar Salim to shine, in a more substantial lead than the majority of his Hollywood roles have afforded him so far. Together, the two build a convincing portrayal of two individuals bound together by a sense of trying to do the right thing in a world where that particular course of action sometimes feels impossible. As Kinley puts it: ""There is a hook in me. One that you cannot see, but it is there."""

That credo is a driving force in this very engaging war/act/thr. This film's unlikely creator is director Guy Ritchie, who's noted for making smug, densely plotted British capers (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) and lavish family films (Aladdin). Serious dramas capturing the horrors of war and the humanity that can prevail aren't in his filmography. Yet somehow, he eschews his gimmicky camerawork and quirky style to tell a straightforward story about the debt that must be paid when someone saves your life. His version of a stripped-down war story isn't as close to the ground as Rod Lurie's The Outpost, but it's close enough. And Ritchie's efforts are aided greatly by co-screenwriters Ivan Atkinson and Marn Davies. The War in Afghanistan rages in 2018 and American armed forces are on the ground. That's the set up. The story develops in four segments. Act I: U.S. Army Sergeant John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal) runs a specialist unit assigned to find and destroy the Taliban's hidden munitions sites. He hires a local interpreter, Ahmed (Dar Salim), who's fluent in four languages. Out on a mission there's a deadly ambush. Act II: One of the two men is severely injured, the other becomes his savior. Act III: One of the two men has survivor anxiety, anguish, PTSD and feelings of guilt that rattle his soul: Act IV: The final mission. A quest. A rescue attempt. The very well written screenplay puts many characters in play. Kinley's unit is filled with dynamic personalities with catchy names whose bawdy banter is funny and disarming: Jizzy (Sean Sagar,) JJ (Jason Wong), Tom Cat (Rhys Yates) and Chow Chow (Christian Ochoa Lavernia). Within minutes it's apparent that locals in jobs as interpreters risk their lives to fight the Taliban and provide food for their families: Kalan (Walid Shahalami) who faces peril, Haadee (Reza Diako) who is vulnerable to bullying and Ahmed.In typical, old Hollywood war movies, one guy is the hero, the alpha. This time there are two leads: A focused, rule-breaking Army sergeant whose wife and children are safe at home in California. And an Afghan mechanic turned interpreter who's lost a family member to the Taliban and seeks refuge in America. Though one is the boss, the other has knowledge of the culture, terrain and people. They need each other and that plays out as they take, relinquish and share power during perilous escape attempts for 2h 3m. It's very reminiscent of the 1958 Tony Curtis and Sidney Portier escape drama The Defiant Ones. Of the four acts, Ritchie, as a director/writer, seems to have a viable plan for three. The third act is the weakest. That's when one of the protagonists displays inner turmoil and needs to settle an obligation. That's when the audiences' attention may drift. The filmmaking descends into quick edits, showing moods and grief. It's too obvious. Instead, maybe the guy should have ignored his responsibilities"

Another one might be: Do they entertain you? And for the most part, I seem to recall finding Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2 fairly entertaining and funny, with the Minions spinoff less so on both counts. The story on any of these movies hardly matters, but the emphasis has tended to be about family, or at least the family to cobble together to help make you a better person. And over the course of the first two films, the supreme villain Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) has amassed a wife, Lucy (Kristen Wiig) and three daughters, who are all quite adorable. With Despicable Me 3, Gru adds a new member to his growing clan, a long-lost twin brother, Dru (also Carell), who he didn't even know about until this film. And when he confronts his mother (Julie Andrews) about it, she confesses that when she split from his father, each of them took one of the twins to raise. Despicable Me 3 opens with what I guess is supposed to be a news piece about the growing threat of a villain named Balthazar Bratt (""South Park"" creator and main vocal talent Trey Parker), a former child actor who played a character meant to be the worst kid in the world. But when his voice broke upon hitting puberty and he stopped being cute, he snapped, taking on the identity of the Bratt character and committing actual acts of evil, such as setting loose every-expanding bubble gum bubbles that push every person and building in its path out of the way violently. He also fancies himself a competitive dancer and insists on having any number of '80s pop tunes playing while he carries out his acts of destruction. In an attempt to steal the world's biggest diamond, Bratt is thwarted (but not caught) by Gru and Lucy, but the new boss of the Anti-Villain League, Valerie Da Vinci (Jenny Slate), isn't happy that Bratt got away, and she fires them, leaving Gru with a lot of time to spend with his family. And then Dru enters to picture, with a full head of golden locks, dressed all in white, and just being generally agreeable and hugely successful. But the two get along splendidly and even being working together. But I know all you people care about are the damn Minions, who naturally return but in a slightly different capacity. Most of them assume that when Gru gets fired from the AVL that he'll return to his villainous roots. When he doesn't, many of them quit in protest, in the hopes of finding a better boss. When they aren't the stars of their own movie, the Minions are still very funny. Many members of the key creative team behind the film have been working on these characters from the beginning.

And Gru discovers his long-lost twin brother, Dru, giving the reforming villain one more reason for a massive group hug! Once the two long-lost brothers unite, this action-packed comedy moves swiftly into a hilarious family film that stresses those old-fashioned family values but in an utterly original way. Old Gru has unfairly lost his job with the Anti-Villain League and his twin brother Dru desperately wants to get into the villainy racket to keep alive, we discover, the family legacy. Gru and Dru are like table tennis players bouncing the running gags with speed and precision.

He watches tapes of old episodes for ideas, corny but effective, and we get to hear his tagline-over and over again-""I've been a bad boy!"" Balthazar manages to steal the world's largest diamond and Gru and Lucy set out to stop him and to earn back the respect of new boss Valerie Da Vinci (Jenny Slate). While Gru and Dru make up for lost time and test out a slew of new gadgets that would make any villain proud, Lucy attempts to bond with the three little girls, who each have subplots of their own, the funniest being Agnes' obsession with finding a real live unicorn. As silly and delightful as ""Despicable Me 3"" is, there are sentimental and warm-fuzzy family moments delivered with genuine sincerity. The true ""Awwww"" moments come when the youngest daughter Agnes tells adoptive mother Lucy, ""I love you, Mom."" The audience remains invested because the story keeps them glued. That's the work of writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul, who've been with the series since the beginning. This is complicated comedy, and for those of us who study structure, I suggest that you get a copy of the screenplay and pour yourself into learning their secrets. ""Despicable Me 3"" is part of a franchise that has already earned more than $1.5 billion worldwide, and that's not counting merchandising or the ""Minions"" movie's additional billion. The uber intelligence of the team leaves this installment open-ended for an unending number of sequels. Jump up and down with glee. The minions will continue to bring the giggles for the next 50 years, I wager. Along with the fast flowing jokes there is"
113,JCD_Doc3_DespicableMe3,JCD_Doc3_DespicableMe3,JCD,Comedy,Positive,Despicable Me 3,"Although Readers at IMDB.com and the critics at Rotten Tomatoes thought otherwise, Despicable Me 3 is just as entertaining as the first sequel to Despicable Me (2010)-the animated feature from Universal that introduced us to the carrot-nosed Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), a villain who was softened up by three orphaned girls. By the third installment, Gru has gone straight and has been working for the Anti-Villain League with his partner/wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig). Because they failed to capture or eliminate Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), a maligned child actor who, as a resentful adult, is driven to become the world's biggest villain, Gru and Lucy find themselves kicked out of the League. But of course that doesn't stop them from tangling with Bratt (aka Bad Boy Bod) again and somehow managing to save the day. That's no spoiler: it's what superheroes and crimefighters do. How much you enjoy Despicable Me 3 may depend on how much you like Gru's ""minions""-those capsule-shaped little yellow guys in blue overalls that speak in their own gibberish language. This outing the minions aren't integral to the plot and only seem deployed in several overly cute (and overly long) sequences designed to satisfy those who do love the little guys, and, of course, to keep those Minion toys and product tie-ins flying off the shelves. They mattered much more in the first two films. Here, they're as gratuitous as nudity in a teen slasher movie. Also marginalized this film are the three orphaned girls that Gru adopted in the first film, so if you thought Mr. Despicable's interaction with those girls a strength, you'll be disappointed to find them underused in Despicable Me 3. Dominating this entry are Gru's interactions with the villain and a twin brother he never knew he had until recently. Carell also gives voice to Dru, the seemingly perfect (and fabulously wealthy and successful) twin from whom he was separated at birth. Reminiscent of the 1988 comedy Twins, in which the genetically perfect Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito, the twin made from DNA leftovers, discover each other, Despicable Me 3 features one twin who is predominantly evil and the other predominantly good. The complication, we learn, is that the successful twin was as much of a disappointment to the villainous-at-heart father who raised him as Gru was to his goody-goody mother. How the brothers learn to cope with who they are and how they were raised, and how they learn to deal with their ""Other"" gets the lion's share of narrative attention. And frankly, the twin brother angle probably rescues the third installment from a familiarity that can make sequels seem tedious. Are there Disney-style wholesome messages implanted here? Sure, if you consider that good triumphs over evil. Despite a large dose of sibling rivalry (that children with siblings can certainly identify with), there are also moments of true caring and brotherly love that shine through. If the voice of Gru's mom sounds familiar, none other than Julie Andrews is behind"
114,JCD_Doc4_DespicableMe3,JCD_Doc4_DespicableMe3,JCD,Comedy,Positive,Despicable Me 3,"Let's start this by saying, me and my kids wore our matching Minions underwear to see Despicable Me 3. We are the target market. And, superficially, it hit the mark. The wee people I was with liked it as evidenced by their near silence and unmovable sack-of-uselessness behavior during the film. If we're grading the movie on that, then A+. This third window into the life of loveable curmudgeon, and mostly-reformed villain, Gru continues exploring its familiar themes: the meaning of family, non-biological parenthood, loyalty, and (surprisingly) nature vs. nurture. First, I want to say I'm here for any movie that highlights that families can be made in so many ways. Gru is still a doting father to his three girls: Edith, Agnes, and Margo. His fatherhood isn't even a question. They are his girls and since the first movie my dude has been willing to risk his life for them. Lucy, however, is still trying to figure out what it means to be a (step)mom. We spent a fair amount of time in DM2 looking at what it means to be a kid who has never (to our knowledge) had a mother. And we ended that movie, of course, on the up note of Agnes reciting a poem about moms while Lucy fought back tears. The biggest twist on family here, though, is the introduction of Dru, Gru's long lost twin brother. Who has hair. And is (kind of) evil. And has hair. Dru's desire to be as evil as Gru once was helps drive the plot as the brothers engage with Balthazar Bratt, the big bad in this installment. This child star turned adult villain brings humor and the necessary evil that Gru and Lucy must fight against. But so much more importantly, he's the reason/excuse for the soundtrack to be sprinkled with that 80s goodness. What I would've liked more of from this movie was attention to plot detail. Yes, I know it's a kids' movie, but let's be honest: I'm going to end up watching it probably 50 more times once the DVD comes out. Dr. Nefario is conveniently sidelined without much explanation-but with nerd reference as a consolation prize. We don't get closure on what happens to the Bratt at the end. He's a villain, so we assume he's defeated. But maybe he's dead? Or maybe he escapes? There are a few other minor characters who don't have their plot points resolved, but we are left to assume everything worked out okay because of the genre. What this movie did absolutely right was juggle storylines. We get Gru and Dru figuring out who they are as brothers and what that means. We get Agnes searching for mythical creatures. The minions are in these streets doing their own thing. Lucy is, as I said, working out the dynamics of being in a blended family. And we, of course, have the good vs. evil that leads the entire franchise. Overall, this is a fun movie in a"
115,JCD_Doc5_DespicableMe3,JCD_Doc5_DespicableMe3,JCD,Comedy,Positive,Despicable Me 3,"Whatever the mood, you'll find yourself in a better one after watching Despicable Me 3. The exhilarating '80s music, a revivified Gru (Steve Carell) and a lesson in family all join to form a mosh pit of a movie that still makes you ultimately smile. The tone is set even before the opening title card with Gru and Lucy (Kristen Wiig) -- his wife and now-fellow Anti-Villain League agent -- hot on the trail of Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker). Bratt is a quite literal child star gone bad (or method): He's become his character from a cheesy '80s TV show called Evil Bratt, in which he played a kid bent on destruction. Tagline? ""I've been a bad boy."" Once puberty hit, Bratt's show was canceled and so was he. He now wants to do to Hollywood what it did to him, chew it up and spit it out, all while wearing the clothes and stuck in the era that Hollywood handed to him. Meta, much? Bratt is a McGuffin, though a mullet-coiffed, dancing-machine one. The real story here is family. Gru made his own with the Minions, then his girls and his new wife. But now comes a revelation: Gru has a shiny, happy brother, with seemingly everything Gru ever wanted, especially that shampoo-commercial hair. But his brother Dru (also Steve Carell) harbors a dark secret. He wants to be bad. But, as bad as Gru can sometimes be at being good, his brother is even worse at being bad. He pressures Gru to keep living up to a legacy that Gru didn't even realize he was perpetuating. That's enough for two movies, but then there are subplots, some contrived, and borrowed plot devices -- I see you Parent Trap -- that are everywhere and nowhere at once. For the emotional payoff, they hardly seem worth the time; really, a search for a unicorn? Then again, what may seem peripatetic to grownups serves as distraction and diversion to little ones. One can hardly write the word distraction without following with mention of the Minions, who find their forces reduced early after Gru rebuffs their calls to ""go dark"" after the encounter with Bratt leaves the family unemployed. That allows the film to get in a Star Wars gag -- and to breathe without having to cater to them and their proud fan base; rudderless, the Minions end up in jail for much of the movie. (Perhaps a timeout is in order after their own movie in 2015?) Picked apart, Despicable Me 3 can be fun and off-putting. First, it never takes itself that seriously, and neither should its audience. Then, even the in jokes have in jokes. The filmmakers may have stuffed 3 with everything and the kitchen sink, perhaps drawing inspiration from the decade to which it pays homage, or maybe they just felt as if the end is nigh. But then, it also sets up a Spy vs. Spy-like continuation, if anyone is so inclined. Taken as a"
116,JCD_Doc6_DespicableMe3,JCD_Doc6_DespicableMe3,JCD,Comedy,Negative,Despicable Me 3,"""Despicable Me 3"" - When thinking about the ""Despicable Me"" series, what is the first image that pops into your mind? Minions, right? Those pintsized, yellow, pill-shaped, lovable devils have caused hilarious havoc in three previous animated adventures, including their own film, ""Minions"" (2015). As entertaining as this collection of miscreants can be, Minions are best served in small, steady and frequent doses. The best film in the series is the second one (2013), in which they were wholly integral to the main narrative but did not dominate the story. In that movie, the main villain, El Macho (Benjamin Bratt), applies a sinister serum that turns our little ""heroes"" into purple, violent maniacs. ""Despicable Me 2"" (2013) found that sweet spot, a balance between not enough Minion-screen time and too much. With ""Despicable Me 3"", directors Eric Guillon, Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin have found balance, not with the Minions, but in a different fashion. In fact, in a very rare life instance, they have ironically applied way too much balance, and the picture suffers. After some unknown time from the second picture, Gru (Steve Carell) and Lucy (Kristen Wiig) are a happy couple, together at work - as agents for the Anti-Villain League (a.k.a. AVL) - and at home with the three girls, Margo, Edith and Agnes. They are nestled into a wonderful existence, but the new AVL head unceremoniously fires both Gru and Lucy. To make matters worse, the Minions leave Gru as well, citing grievances for not enough villainy in their mentor's new happy life. With some semblance of good news, Gru discovers that he has a twin, a long-lost brother named Dru (Steve Carell as well). So, he, Lucy, the girls, and a pair of Minions (who stuck around) promptly leave for some place called Freedonia, and they meet Dru, who seems quite agreeable and giddy to catch up for lost time with his sibling. Conflict arises, however, when Dru wishes to take up a life of crime and learn from the best, his brother, but Gru's somewhat recent turn as a good guy creates quite the pickle for him in Freedonia. The film fashions quite a pickle for the audience, because writers Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio jam about 1,000,006 stories into a movie that is listed as 1 hour 30 minutes, but with a quick, unscientific glance at my watch - while in theatre - it only ran for 1 hour 25 minutes. ""Despicable Me 3"" apparently is the shortest film in the series, but with so many plot threads, it never devotes enough time in developing any of them. It seems that Guillon, Balda and Coffin hoped to tender the same commitment to ""every"" character, but to the audience's detriment. Lucy struggles with her role as a mom, Gru grapples with his brother's criminal intensions, Agnes endlessly drones on and on about finding a unicorn, and the Minions drift on their own, attempting to discover a new purpose. I have not even mentioned"
117,JCD_Doc7_DespicableMe3,JCD_Doc7_DespicableMe3,JCD,Comedy,Negative,Despicable Me 3,"For the past few years, the Despicable Me franchise's Minions - the humanoid, cheddar-yellow creatures who speak in gibberish, have varying numbers of eyes, and harbor desire to don women's undergarments - have become a cultural force on their own. They're part of an inescapable meme. They've won the affection of our nation's children. Their popularity is so potent that after Despicable Me 2 came out in 2013, they even headlined their own movie, 2015's aptly titled Minions. At this point, it's nearly impossible to imagine a Despicable Me film that doesn't rely heavily on the diminutive, pill-shaped beings to drive its story. But the franchise's latest entry, Despicable Me 3, puts a noble effort into returning the Minions and the franchise to its roots. This installment, co-directed by Eric Guillon, Kyle Balda, and Pierre Coffin (who also voices all the Minions), sees the reformed supervillain Gru (Steve Carell), his wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig), and their adopted daughters Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Nev Scharrel) working out what it means to be a family. At the same time, Gru meets a twin brother he never knew existed. And the upshot is that the Minions are pushed out of the spotlight (as much as anyone can do with a force like the Minions). Essentially, Despicable Me 3 relegates them to sideshow status, deploying their antics more in segues between scenes, as opposed to giving them their own extensive plot. The result is a warm, endearing throwback to what made the first Despicable Me movie so special: the idea of family - both the kind we choose and the kind that chooses us - and the vulnerabilities inherent in opening yourself up to that family. Despicable Me 3 is not fully successful, as it's stuffed with too many competing plots and subplots involving everything from unemployment, new bosses, and a villain voiced by South Park's Trey Parker to '80s nostalgia, exploring a foreign country, and Gru's brother Dru, who we previously didn't know existed. But there's still a lot to like, and Despicable Me 3 leaves us with a lot to look forward to, should Universal keep the franchise going with a fourth movie. The single best moment of the Despicable Me franchise happens toward the end of the first film. In the middle of the final supervillain battle, Gru rescues Margo, Edith, and Agnes from his enemy, Vector (Jason Segel). Earlier in the movie, Gru had adopted the three girls and then abandoned them, and now he must fight to get them back. So as she's being rescued, Margo is hesitant to jump into Gru's arms, because she's afraid he might leave her again. But he insists. ""Margo, I will always catch you. I will never let you go again,"" he yells to her, before she jumps. It's a small, tender moment that simultaneously gets at both characters' vulnerabilities, their fears, and the spirit of the story, which argues that allowing yourself to love someone and letting them"
118,JCD_Doc8_DespicableMe3,JCD_Doc8_DespicableMe3,JCD,Comedy,Negative,Despicable Me 3,"Despicable Me 3 is an example of how even the most promising animated franchises can hit a wall if allowed to continue too long. One can understand why Universal greenlit this film. The previous two (or three if you count the spin-off Minions) made a ton of money. Kids and adults loved them. Financially, there's no argument to be made against the development of this sequel. Creatively... well, that's another matter. The first two Despicable Me movies formed a full character arc. They told the entirety of Gru's story. To add a third film to the series, the filmmakers were forced to re-mine familiar territory while adding extraneous material. To an adult, Despicable Me 3 seems pointless, redundant, and even a little desperate. The charm is gone. Kids, on the other hand, will reactive positively, but they approach movies like this from a different perspective. For younger, viewers, this is a chance to spend some time with old friends. It offers humor, action, and adventure. However, while Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2 were made with viewers of all ages in mind, Despicable Me 3 is targeted primarily at the under-10 crowd (with jokes to match). Aside from a soundtrack stuffed with '80s songs, there's little here to appeal to anyone born before the turn of the century. When Minions disappointed relative to pre-release expectations, autopsies identified the problem as the absence of Gru. The Steve Carell-voiced character, they reasoned, was as important an ingredient as his squeaky yellow friends. Universal had mistakenly assumed that the Minions were the reason for the success of the first two films. I suppose the box office will tell whether this was an accurate analysis but Despicable Me 3 feels more like Minions than its same-title predecessors. The ""spark"" is gone; the cash cow is going through the motions. Few animated franchises make it to installment #3 without a marked decline in quality; Toy Story is an outlier. There is a story, although it's fragmented into several pieces. When Gru (Carell) and his new wife, Lucy (Kristin Wiig), are fired from their jobs at the AVL, Gru finds himself at loose ends. Enter his long-lost twin, Dru (also Carell), who wants to team up with his brother for one epic criminal escapade. While Gru and Dru are bonding and preparing for their nefarious caper, which involves stealing a diamond from noted bad guy and notorious moonwalker Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), Lucy begins to suspect that her husband may be veering from the straight-and-narrow. Meanwhile, the Minions, left on their own, end up in prison where they subjugate the entire population. And Gru's two youngest kids go off on a unicorn quest. All of that doesn't sound substantive enough to fill up 90 minutes and it really isn't. Despicable Me 3 feels more like an extended cartoon than a full-length feature. It's less ambitious and colorful in every way than the earlier two films. The animation is workmanlike but isn't going to challenge Cars 3"
119,JCD_Doc9_DespicableMe3,JCD_Doc9_DespicableMe3,JCD,Comedy,Negative,Despicable Me 3,"The Despicable Me series has shown there is life outside Pixar and Disney, both commercially and artistically, in the blockbuster animation world, with its sentimental-querulous figurehead Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) and fondness for idiosyncratic grotesques. So here we are at number three - not counting, of course, the prequel-spinoff Minions, in which Gru's babbling army of small yellow helpers took centre stage. While all the elements that brought the first two Despicable Mes inordinate popularity are present and correct, it might perhaps be churlish to suggest that the charm is beginning to wear off - just a tiny bit. On the face of it, this third film simply extends the sentimental undertow of its predecessors. Having acquired children (in DM1) and a wife (Lucy, voiced by Kristen Wiig, in DM2), Gru this time discovers he has a twin, Dru (voiced, again, by Carell). Possessed of hair, a sunny outlook and substantial material possessions, Dru is pitched as the polar opposite to his surly, self-hating long-lost brother; he is also keen to re-establish the family tradition of supervillany - the very practice Gru has turned his back on. It's only a matter of minutes before a heated sibling rivalry is raging. Shortly before the reconnection with Dru, however, Gru and Lucy have managed to get themselves fired from their crimefighting org, the Anti Villain League, after botching the pursuit of a bubblegum-toting, Rubik's Cube-wielding supervillain Balthazar Bratt (South Park's Trey Parker). Bratt is a rather entertaining creation, even if it's the apotheosis of the movies' increasingly teethgrinding obsession with self-referential pop culture. Bratt is the former kiddie star of an 80s TV show and - complete with mullet hairstyle, weaponised guitar-synth and repeated challenges to dance-fights - utilises cheesy 80s style to ballast his villainous moves to take revenge for his Hollywood rejection. The extended sections devoted to Bratt, including a prologue in which he captures a ship containing the largest diamond in the world, are Despicable Me's best and funniest sequences, overflowing with ideas and gags. They also prompt the film's not-all-that-imaginative jukebox soundtrack of 80s hits - Michael Jackson's Bad, aHa's Take on Me, Madonna's Into the Groove. Perhaps younger members of the audience might consider them cultish ancient tunes, but to the slightly more seasoned filmgoer it's an indication that under the eyepopping lysergic visuals there's a basic unadventurousness to proceedings. Perhaps it's inevitable after the impressive impact the first in the series made, with its distinctive combination of daftness and dyspepsia; a sort of closing the circle. The Gru/Dru thread also shows the strain. It looks initially like it will provide rich easily-mined territory - including the sinister implication, apparent in their first meeting, that Dru might replace his brother in his family's affections. But it runs out of steam pretty quickly, with little made of their rivalry other than Dru's attempt to steer Gru back to villainy. Wiig's Lucy is also saddled with a pedestrian am-I-a-good-mom journey which doesn't do her character any favours either."
120,JCD_Doc10_DespicableMe3,JCD_Doc10_DespicableMe3,JCD,Comedy,Negative,Despicable Me 3,"At what point to film series and franchises begin to lose their bite? Despicable Me 3 aims to answer that question and the result is not what the studio is anticipating. In 2010, Illumination Entertainment stumbled upon a premise that would lift its stock to a point not far below the greats of Disney, Pixar, and DreamWorks. Their concept of an archvillain using children as pawns, but discovering a genuine affection for them was a novel concept in animation and the end result was a warm, sweet exploration of fatherhood and family. Three years later, that film's immense popularity led to a continuation of the story where Gru (Steve Carell) falls in love with a secret agent (Kristen Wiig) while his family is threatened by the machinations of a new villainous threat. The film was a solid effort, but began showing signs of limited potential. Gru was turned into a good guy and his nefarious schemes felt like an ever-present, but modestly distant memory. The familial joy was there, but a bit diminished. It was enjoyable, but not as moving as the original. They followed this with an ill-advised prequel based on the popular pill-shaped Minions of the first two films. These critters speak in a language only they can understand, but which the audience can pick up contextual and visual clues to comprehend. This slow-moving film was a decided downward collapse of the series and laid the groundwork for concern over its future. Now we come to the fourth film of Illuminations bread-and-butter franchise and it is a direct continuance of the characters and storylines of the second film. This time out, Gru and Lucy are in pursuit of a former child star-turned-villain (Trey Parker) who has plotted to steal a massive pink diamond. To complicate matters, Gru discovers that he has a long-lost twin(ish) brother named Dru. Dru always wanted to be the supervillain Gru was, but had to satisfy himself with playing spy in his own mind and with the vast wealth his father left him. As Dru and Gru explore their fraternal relationship, they must work together alongside Lucy to break into Balathazar Bratt's heavily-defended compound and retrieve the purloined gem while bonding in the process. Many antiquated tropes of the spy and thriller genre, such as the family-in-distress dynamic, are on full display here and the machismo that has permeated the series threatens to undermine the jovial and friendly atmosphere the series once reveled in. Pierre Coffin, who has been a part of the production, directing, and writing team since the beginning, has been shepherding the franchise towards its massive box office takes and popular approval, he has seemingly forgotten what had made the original film so special. That sense of emotional and paternal growth felt genuine and irrepressible. Now, it feels gratuitous and inconsequential, tacked on to tie it into the previous films, but lacking the sincerity. This fourth incarnation has lost its way. Paying lip service to its own origins and haphazardly connecting"
121,JLC_Doc1_HolmesAndWatson,JLC_Doc1_HolmesAndWatson,JLC,Comedy,Negative,Holmes and Watson,"Out of some morbid curiosity, and perhaps a self-destructive streak, I decided to watch the much-hated Holmes & Watson starring Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. Although many adore the abrasive charms of Talladega Nights (2006) and Step Brothers (2008), these movies have never appealed to me, often outstaying their welcome around the twenty-minute mark. My decision to screen their the latest comedy, which bombed during last year's holiday season, was less about genuine interest than peer pressure. ""It's so bad,"" a number of people have told me. ""You have to see it."" Putting it on largely as background noise, I instantly regretted the decision. Holmes & Watson is frustratingly stupid within the first seconds (it opens with a quote from Hannah Montana) and continues for a painfully long, utterly laughless 90 minutes. In the movie, Ferrell and Reilly reduce two of literature's most celebrated, intelligent characters to bungling idiots. Performed with vaguely effeminate mannerisms that should come across as an insult to the British, Holmes (Ferrell) and Watson (Reilly) investigate, sort of, a mystery to which the details are instantly foggy-honestly, as I write this, I just watched the movie and couldn't tell you what it's about. I can tell you it's set in London during the early 1900s, and the production's costumes, hair and makeup, and interiors look professional. The cast is also amazing; it boasts several excellent, but absolutely wasted UK performers (Ralph Fiennes, Hugh Laurie, Kelly Macdonald, Steve Coogan, Rob Brydon). The largely reference-based humor is dated, to the point where you wonder if the joke is so meta that it's less about the reference itself than a self-aware gag about the dated quality of the reference. An absurd morgue scene riffs on the Patrick Swayze/Demi Moore's pottery scene in Ghost (1990); the ending features Billy Zane reprising his role from Titanic (1997); and several sequences lampoon those moments from Sherlock Holmes and its 2011 sequel, when Robert Downey Jr. anticipated a series of moves that would incapacitate his enemy. Elsewhere, the movie's attempts at randomness fall flat. Jokes about Holmes' intelligence giving him psychic powers do not pair well with his inability to choose a style of hat, a thread that often leaves him looking like a pimp stereotype. An out-of-left-field musical number ushers in the third act, while the modern hip-hop music courtesy of Mark Mothersbaugh desperately wants you to know it's out of place. And the whole time, you'll be wondering why any of this exists. The entire thing is embarrassing and difficult to endure. Despite the short runtime, I stopped the movie more than once to take a break; however, I resisted giving up on it completely, if only because I didn't want to waste the $5 rental charge. I can only be thankful that I didn't venture into the theater, as I would have been forced to endure the full 90 minutes in a single sitting, which would have been something akin to self-imposed waterboarding. Truly, the only laughs to be"
122,JLC_Doc2_HolmesAndWatson,JLC_Doc2_HolmesAndWatson,JLC,Comedy,Negative,Holmes and Watson,"There's a moment during the stunningly abysmal Holmes & Watson where you're looking up at the screen and you're watching the immensely talented duo of John C. Reilly and Steve Coogan and, at least if you're an avid moviegoer, you realize that these actors, awful beyond awful in this film, have both turned in award-worthy, and I'd dare say Oscar worthy, performances this very same year in the extraordinary Stan & Ollie. The realization hits you hard. I mean seriously hard. It's difficult to describe just how wide this chasm is, but the closest thing I can find to describe it is the year that Eddie Murphy garnered serious Oscar buzz for Dreamgirls but just as nominations were being submitted Murphy's similarly devastatingly awful Norbit was released in theaters. Not surprisingly, all the Oscar buzz in the world couldn't save Murphy's reputation and despite a tremendous Dreamgirls performance it's safe to say that Norbit came close to killing Murphy's career. While Reilly is likely safe from a similar fate here, especially given he's actually given award-worthy performances this year in both Stan & Ollie and The Sisters Brothers, a film so incredibly awful as Holmes & Watson may very well sound the off-key death chimes on Ferrell's already waning career as audiences tire of his man-child shtick and his films exude the rotted stench of cinematic desperation. And, let me just say, this is coming from someone who considers himself a Will Ferrell fan. There's simply no excuse whatsoever for a film as awful as Holmes & Watson. Holmes & Watson is so awful that people in third world countries who've never seen a film before would watch the film and decide they've not been missing anything. Holmes & Watson is simply lazy. It's lazy writing. It's lazy filmmaking. It's haphazard, self-indulgent, and so utterly devoid of anything resembling humor that it's inexcusable that it was even released in theaters. This is the kind of film that indie filmmakers look at shrug their shoulders thinking ""How can I not catch a break?"" And they have a point. The film has a brilliant supporting cast, most of whom have this deer-in-the-headlights look like ""Even for a paycheck film, this is really gonna' suck."" They're right. The likes of Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon and Hugh Laurie and the nearly always impeccable Rebecca Hall are completely and utterly wasted here, far from impeccable and even farther from even watchable. It's never a good sign when even a comedy film's trailer doesn't contain a single laugh, but even entering the theater with low expectations somehow Holmes & Watson is even worse. Writer/director Etan Cohen (Get Hard) seems to have constructed a feature-length film out of a college-level first draft that takes familiar Sherlock Holmes material and finds nothing creative or unique or entertaining to do with it. While both Ferrell and Reilly can unquestionably be funny, whether you like their previous efforts Talladega Nights and Step Brothers or not, what unfolds here feels"

Or any day, for that matter. If you missed the Christmas Day arrival of Holmes & Watson on the big screen, consider yourself forgiven: the film wasn't screened for critics and received scant promotion in advance of its release. Consider yourself lucky, too, because if you were planning on seeing the movie based on the kinds of Will Ferrell-John C. Reilly zingers that peppered Talladega Nights and Step Brothers, be assured that there are almost none to be had in this third pairing of the comic duo. Ferrell's Get Hard writer-director Etan Cohen does double duty again here, but fails to coax his two stars into any kind of comic rhythm. Credit the script, which is a clunky mix of ancient jokes, pratfalls and geriatric gags designed to distract us from the fact that there is no story here at all, just the lame and slightly sad sight of grown actors peeing themselves when they're worried the laughs have run dry. Sherlock Holmes has been done to death in recent years by the likes of Robert Downey Jr, Jonny Lee Miller, Ian McKellen, Benedict Cumberbatch, an animated Johnny Depp, and Canada's own Matt Frewer, to name a few. But this is not a ""new spin"" on an old character: here Holmes has been so stripped of any literary reference it's a wonder they bothered with it at all. Sherlock Holmes (Ferrell) and Dr. John Watson (Reilly) are pressed into service after a murder at Buckingham Palace. A calling card is left by the scheming Professor James Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes, what were you thinking?) who declares that he will kill the queen in four days' time if the first murder goes unsolved. Holmes alternates between genius and dum-dum. Watson is dissatisfied as Holmes' sidekick, though the doctor's offers of ""heroin or cocaine?"" seem to be his chief medical qualification and means of advancement. Neither actor looks like they're having any fun, regardless of the calibre of the jokes. In addition to Fiennes, given only a few lines, a standout supporting cast is criminally underused. ""Lady doctor"" Dr. Grace Hart (Rebecca Hall) and her mute companion Millicent (Lauren Lapkus) serve as love interests for the clueless sleuths. Rob Brydon (The Trip) plays the much-maligned Scotland Yard Inspector Lestrade, and frequent collaborator Steve Coogan makes an appearance as a tattooist. Kelly McDonald plays Holmes' horny housekeeper; Hugh Laurie plays Holmes' smarter brother (and yes, we've seen that movie before, too). The jokes rely heavily on anachronism (MAGA-inspired hats... in Victorian England! Duck-faced selfies with an antique camera!) and masturbation, which, to be fair, was believed to be the cause of many a Victorian-era affliction. This may be the first Sherlock film in which our literary wunderkind pees his pants, so there's that. It's lazy, it's unfunny and it's a good thing critics didn't"
124,JLC_Doc4_HolmesAndWatson,JLC_Doc4_HolmesAndWatson,JLC,Comedy,Negative,Holmes and Watson,"The start of Holmes & Watson is both cynical and inexplicable. Dr. Watson (John C. Reilly), apparently fed up of his life, is about to launch himself from the roof of Sherlock Holmes's flat building onto his prized plant, which Holmes (Will Ferrell) doesn't want him to. ""Fall over there!"" he says, because a human life is less important than a plant's, according to the film. Cynical, because of that. Inexplicable, because the two for some reason become friends right after. The basic premise of the film is this: Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes) has apparently fled to America to avoid arrest, and used a lookalike to take the fall. Lestrade (Rob Bydon) doesn't believe him, but Holmes runs with the theory regardless. Meanwhile, people are still being murdered, and the question that keeps being asked is, ""if the criminal who can outsmart Holmes isn't Moriarty,then who is it?"". It all culminates into some half-baked mystery about someone wanting to kill the Queen of England (Pam Ferris). Holmes & Watson's main downfall is that it doesn't make sense on any account. If Moriarty is clever enough to avoid being captured by Sherlock Holmes, why would he have fled to America to begin with? Why does he send a dead body in a cake to Buckingham Palace? To send a message? Surely, if you're going to commit such a high-profile murder you wouldn't want anyone to know you were planning it, even if you were Moriarty. The fallacies don't end there. Writer/director Etan Cohen couldn't have understood what film he was making, because conceptually Holmes and Watson is all over the place. At the beginning of the film, Holmes is portrayed as someone who only thinks he's hyper-intelligent, but is actually more incompetent than the people around him. But a couple of scenes later, Holmes will actually be intelligent, and then the comedy will stem from the fact that the people surrounding him are portrayed as idiots. The film is lazily written, too. It's very difficult to tell whether it was supposed to be some kind of referential humour, but there's a boxing scene which plays out almost exactly like a scene from one of the earlier Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes films (of which I wasn't a fan, but compared to this one, they're like Citizen Kane). The joke is, of course, that the method of taking out his foe doesn't work, and he almost gets pummelled. But the film has no sense of comic timing, and by that point, the joke has already been used a couple of times, and just feels exhausting. The same is true of almost the entire script. There are chuckles here and there, but nowhere near enough to build a feature film on. I'll give Etan Cohen this: he was trying to make a clever comedy. Or at least, I think so. There are a couple of jokes which were designed to be political commentary, which are pretty much all critical of the Trump Administration. None"
125,JLC_Doc5_HolmesAndWatson,JLC_Doc5_HolmesAndWatson,JLC,Comedy,Negative,Holmes and Watson,"There is something of an art to spoofing. While often unfairly labeled a poor man's satire, a great spoof is a well-timed, immaculately planned and quite glorious thing. That's what separates The Naked Gun's from the Meet the Spartans and the Rowan Atkinson's from the nameless teens who pube joked their way through all those lame Scary Movie cash-ins. Yet, sometimes, a film comes along with all the ingredients but - rather ironically in this case - not a clue what to do with them. Holmes & Watson is that film. This re-teaming of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly ought to have been a sleuthing celebration of silly; instead it's one of the most baffling cinematic turkeys of last year. The plot, such as it is, sees Sherlock Holmes (Farrell) faced with his greatest challenge yet, foiling an impending assassination of the Queen. Meanwhile, his trusted companion Dr. Watson (Reilly) finally hopes to do more than hold the magnifying glasses, as the game is afoot and takes the pair on an unexpected journey. Holmes & Watson is head-scratchingly unfunny. Filled to busting with talent and potential that, say in the hands of Aardman animation, might flourish as well as it should, but here it all falls disappointingly flat. For the relatively brief 90-minute duration you find yourself fidgetingly feeling it's double the length, as everything Etan Cohen's script pulls out, fails to muster any semblance of a laugh. Already the film has become quite infamous for its bad reception and walkouts (there was one at our - admittedly sparse - screening) and it's hardly surprising. The spark and mad chemistry of Ferrell and Reilly's previous unions is extinguished by the dated script (save for the odd Donald Trump jab) and sequences that have been done before and immeasurably better. The movie's biggest crime though, aside from its casual abandonment of plot and point, is its absurd level of waste. The sets and period detail are exceptional, as are the costumes, but it's all wasted as window dressing to piss poor gags and weirdly uncomfortable levels of cringe (a selfie sight gag) with ill-fitting music accompaniment. Then there's the cast, which is rich in excellence and up for anything! Unforgivably though, there is sod all for any of them to do. Ferrell and Reilly attempt to lead by example but this Arthur Conan Doyle inspired comedy carnival is too much of a mess to save, and they are left wailing and flailing aimlessly (at one point literally). Rebecca Hall, Pam Ferris and Kelly MacDonald are cluelessly flung into scenes, Rob Brydon has virtually no chance to drop anything resembling a joke (or barely even a line), Steve Coogan is sinfully wasted in a stunningly brief fight scene (the film's best bit actually) and the often unappreciated comic flair of Ralph Fiennes goes once more untapped and he's entirely squandered as Moriarty. The cameos range from award winning actors to WWE wrestler and everyone tries to wrangle something out of this"
126,JLC_Doc6_HolmesAndWatson,JLC_Doc6_HolmesAndWatson,JLC,Comedy,Positive,Holmes and Watson,"The comedy so execrable that audiences evacuated before it ended. The abomination so unholy that Netflix allegedly doused holy water on it in rejection. The massive miscalculation that, at least for a time, registered a giant goose egg on Rotten Tomatoes. Bound for box-office ignominy and an inevitable rout of its 2018 Razzie contenders, Holmes & Watson is the fourth* collaboration between Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, playing the title characters in that order. And it would certainly seem to be an unmitigated disaster. If only the results were so elementary. Sure, Holmes & Watson mines familiar ground, opening on yet another purposefully misattributed quote a la Ferrell and Reilly's main works, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby and Step Brothers. It's also a bountiful orchard of low-hanging fruit by way of anachronistic jokes that pad the movie to a commercially acceptable feature-length. Some are amusing, such as the continued presumption of cocaine, heroin and opiates as a pinnacle of medical treatment or an ""intoxigram"" as the drunk-text antecedent. Some are anemic, like the ""platypus-faced self-photograph"" preceding the duck-lips selfie. But the film is a far sight funnier than writer-director Etan Cohen's first outing with Ferrell (the witless prison comedy Get Hard). And even as Holmes & Watson never rises to Brothers' sublimely absurd skewering of male maturity, it's a brainier blunderbuss of buffoonish satire than Talladega. (Quite tough to hoist a convincingly rigid middle finger at NASCAR culture when your other hand's fist-bumping the top brass to gain organizational support.) Holmes & Watson presupposes that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's standard-bearers for seamless logic are instead both utter dimwits dining out on long-faded success. Exuding even more fey-dandy energy than he did as Mugatu, Ferrell envisions Sherlock Holmes as an impudent man-baby as reliant on drugs to keep going as he is the codependency of his relationship with Dr. John Watson. Reilly indulges in spikier slapstick than usual to make Watson a trigger-happy dunce whose mantle of authority seems honorary at best. We first meet Sherlock in his school days, bullied by his peers into kissing a donkey's ass. After learning to ""uncry"" and lock away his emotions, Sherlock gets the entirety of his school expelled (leaving the teachers to focus solely on his intellect) and takes as his only friend a young John. It's no accident that the opening credits breeze through the pair's salad days of criminal investigation. Holmes & Watson wants us to consider them as morons obsessed with public adulation and elevated perception of past glories that are, in all likelihood, more exaggerated than we've been led to believe. Sound like anyone we've heard from a lot for the last few years? Sure, Cohen goes mallet-on-the-head about it with a couple of obvious verbal / sight gags, but it's a winking dig at the continued selfish supremacy of the male ego. These are men who have utterly lost what little step they might have had in the first place and are, at least initially,"
127,JLC_Doc7_HolmesAndWatson,JLC_Doc7_HolmesAndWatson,JLC,Comedy,Positive,Holmes and Watson,"Maybe it's just the holiday spirit, but I can't find it in myself to be particularly frustrated by Holmes and Watson. Admittedly, it's no Step Brothers, and I can't help wishing for a more bizarre cut of the film (there's an undercurrent of weirdness to the whole affair that feels somehow tempered), but if it feels a little elementary compared to the best of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly's work (the aforementioned Step Brothers, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, etc.), that's not necessarily a damning distinction. That Ferrell and Reilly should take on Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, respectively, feels like a logical next step for the comedy duo, as they've made something of a speciality out of two-handers featuring Ferrell as the bright star and Reilly as the yearning sidekick. Granted, their particular spin on Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous creations paints his legendarily brilliant pair as emotionally stunted morons, but the point still stands: There's an archetype that the story fulfills that's a perfect match. What makes the film more than a retread, however, is also what makes it so unwieldy. As the detective and doctor work toward foiling an assassination attempt on the Queen (Pam Ferris) by none other than Professor Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes), the situations they find themselves in become increasingly bizarre. Part of it is to do with the fact that cracking the case is secondary to cracking open their hearts, and part of it is a seeming indecision as to exactly what Holmes and Watson is meant to be. It's not quite the absurdist art that Step Brothers is, nor entirely the political commentary of Talladega Nights (a sharper look at the Bush years than this year's Vice, with all due apologies to Adam McKay); instead, it falls halfway in between, failing to make a completely coherent meal out of either approach. That said, if I had to wager (with the full acknowledgment that such speculation is meaningless), I would say that director Etan Cohen was trying for something more in line with the former, as there are bizarre interludes scattered throughout that suggest a much stranger film. The best word to describe those moments is ""grotesque,"" as the film's sense of humor goes beyond the usual scatological jokes - plus the requisite period comedy jabs at modern culture and technological advancements, and some laughs at the expense of previous iterations of Holmes and Watson - and ventures into genuinely strange territory. One scene, doubling down on Watson's status as a sidekick rather than an equal, introduces something called the ""companions' room."" The roster of characters introduced there is so strange that their split-second appearance, a far cry from the triter set pieces that populate the rest of the film, is deeply jarring. Another gag spins fun out of the effects of poison, while the film's opening sequence alone involves not only turtle rehabilitation but the coining of the term ""un-crying."" It's that weirdness that makes the film's big emotional payoff"
128,JLC_Doc8_HolmesAndWatson,JLC_Doc8_HolmesAndWatson,JLC,Comedy,Positive,Holmes and Watson,"Many distinguished actors have played Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson, but few have done so with quite the unhinged abandon of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly - reunited here a decade after the unforgettable Step Brothers, where they starred as grown men still living with their parents and squabbling like little kids. Holmes and Watson is essentially a continuation of the same project, in the form of a parody that has less to do with the writings of Arthur Conan Doyle than it does with the spectacle of man-children playing dress-ups. Etan Cohen (Get Hard) is the credited writer-director, but we're given the impression - accurate or not - that the leads are pretty much inventing their lines as they go along. As the world's greatest detective, Ferrell purses his lips, flutters his hands, and speaks in a strangled approximation of a refined English accent. As his loyal sidekick, Reilly stands by, nodding sagely and occasionally breaking out into a girlish giggle. Both spend a lot of time screaming at the tops of their lungs, recklessly brandishing dangerous weapons and congratulating each other on their superiority to everyone else - in a manner only possible for a couple of all-American yahoos pretending to be upper-crust 19th-century Brits. In theory this dynamic duo is dashing around jolly old London in pursuit of nemesis Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes), who has apparently returned from beyond the grave to sabotage Holmes' birthday party and threaten the life of Queen Victoria (Pam Ferris). The plot is so rickety it could fall apart at any moment ... which of course is partly the point in a film that aims for the pure, old-fashioned silliness of The Goon Show or early Steve Martin. Holmes and Watson is not for everybody, but if you want to see Ferrell off the leash this is the best opportunity in a long time. The joy of a relentlessly juvenile approach is that it succeeds in making every previous version of the material look just as ridiculous: Guy Ritchie's macho vehicles for Robert Downey Jr come in for special ribbing, but Cohen and his stars have surely taken a look at the BBC's maudlin Sherlock as well. There are broader satirical implications, too, even setting aside the handful of obligatory Trump jokes. With his brash eccentricities, his disdain for women and his ""superhuman"" intellect, Holmes can be viewed as a template for countless pulp heroes who have flourished since - all of them basically fantasy alter-egos for nerdy teenage boys. Ferrell, who has made a career out of mocking male insecurities, clearly understands this well. It's not for nothing that one of the early comic routines here has him and Reilly reeling off a list of increasingly elaborate synonyms for ""wanking""."
129,JLC_Doc9_HolmesAndWatson,JLC_Doc9_HolmesAndWatson,JLC,Comedy,Positive,Holmes and Watson,"One of the year's most critically shellacked movies (the pros were forced to watch it in theaters on Christmas Day alongside the common hordes), Holmes & Watson begins as ineptly as any comedy I've seen, and then settles into an agreeably silly groove that had the common hordes around me yukking it up. When it's bad it is, indeed, painful, but even third-rate Will Ferrell + John C. Reilly is more inspired than the noisy contraptions on either side of it in the multiplex. The twist is to make Sherlock Holmes, Arthur Conan Doyle's pillar of 19th-century rationalism, into the latest of Ferrell's posturing child-men, another symbol of the patriarchy's dimming light. After being tricked by grade-school classmates into kissing the arse of an ass when he thought he'd be kissing a girl, Holmes purges himself of emotion and becomes a giant brain doling out punishments to those who would underestimate his powers of ratiocination. Those powers in Holmes & Watson are rather elastic. Where the trend in modern Holmesiana has been to show the great detective as a stunted giant, Ferrell stunts the stuntedness, playing Holmes as a prissy drama queen who's at least half idiot and always - even when brilliant - a fount of chaos. He and his schoolmate, Dr. John Watson (Reilly), have never really left the playground. The rub is not that Ferrell and Reilly act like overgrown 11-year-olds - that was the hook in Adam McKay's Step Brothers, a high-water mark in modern infantile comedy. It's that Ferrell's brand of low comedy is best executed with high instincts - i.e., without the nudge-nudges and wink-winks. Watch Ferrell and Reilly make the breathless case to Richard Jenkins's exasperated father/stepfather in Step Brothers that they should be allowed to create a bunk bed by setting one twin bed atop another: Their enthusiasm is contagious. Watch the pair's Funny or Die line-for-line reenactment of the unintentionally surreal duet between Bing Crosby at death's door and a joyless David Bowie: so subtle, so sublime. Holmes & Watson, on the other hand, is camp. Worse: rhythmless camp. It has been consistently misdirected by its screenwriter, Etan Coen (no ""h,"" different guy), whose idea of editing is to make throwaway jokes broad and broad jokes bludgeoning. As a director, Coen commits comedy's most cardinal sin: He gets between us and the performers. (To see how central rhythm is, watch Reilly and Steve Coogan's delicate work in Stan and Ollie: The beats - and micro-beats - are exquisite.) The first 15 minutes or so of Holmes & Watson made me doubt I'd last the next 90, an impulse to flee that I also detected, with Holmesian sensitivity, in Ralph Fiennes, who's stuck playing Dr. Moriarty and/or a look-alike. You can read his frozen face: What did I get myself into? Rob Brydon's Inspector Lestrade is photographed to appear as diminutive as possible, and the actor gets to show none of his improvisatory gifts. Kelly Macdonald as Mrs. Hudson reveals why she's"

Reilly will be able to say that this is the best of their work together (in fact, it's the worst: not only were they more in tune in 'Past Turns' and 'Brothers for balls', but in both cases the overall quality of the films - especially Adam McKay's 2008 masterpiece - was far superior). However, the very negative reviews, the 0% on Rotten Tomatoes that it held for one season or the news of people leaving the theaters en masse seem a bit out of the ordinary. It is indisputable that 'Holmes and Watson' is not a round film: there are gags that should not have made the cut or, at least, should have been moderated on the editing table. The staging is infinitely flatter than the curious proposals that McKay sometimes presents, always redounding in favor of the joke. Ferrell and Reilly aren't as loose as on other occasions, although they do exhibit some anthology improvisation. Some humorous devices (the less fortunate anachronisms, the dull musical number, and the hilarious but ultimately somewhat repetitive parody of Guy Ritchie's ""stream of thought"" Holmes) are exhausted by insistence. And the concessions to mainstream comedy (moral, romantic plot), weigh more than on other occasions. However, the cruelty has been excessive: from pointing out technical errors typical of amateur cinema (which I have not detected) to qualifying it as the worst film of the year, when without going any further, among the Oscar nominees there was one that another one more deserving of that qualification. 'Holmes and Watson' is an easy comedy at times, yes, sometimes less elaborate than what Ferrell and Reilly are used to, but without a doubt it deserves a little more affection. At the very least, by fans of his sophisticated mix of parody, excess, and kindergarten jokes. Its problems can possibly be attributed to its director and screenwriter Etan Cohen, whose name we are not going to comment on because, as is easy to suppose, it has already endured all possible variations. Among his achievements is the direction of the nice 'Give it hard', with Ferrell himself and Kevin Hart, as well as the scripts for 'Idiocracy', 'Tropic Thunder' or 'Men in Black 3'. Nothing particularly revolutionary, but certainly it does denote a career of someone committed to comedy and fairly knowledgeable of its springs. All in all, and together with 'Tropic Thunder', this could be his best film. On this occasion, Holmes (Ferrell) and Watson (Reilly) are the detective and his faithful companion, with the attributes that legend ascribes to both. Cerebral, extremely intelligent, almost robotic one; and affable, human and impulsive the other. The plot leads them to face the eternal nemesis of the world's greatest detective, Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes, criminally wasted) and team up with a doctor from Boston (Rebecca Hall). The great comic weapon of 'Holmes and Watson' is possibly the anachronism. That is where the"

The good news is that they have this tremendously funny mainstream comedy out now: a cracking crowdpleaser, also featuring some repertory players from Fey's TV gem 30 Rock, written by SNL regular Paula Pell and directed by Jason Moore, who gave us Pitch Perfect. It's what critics rather airily call an ""audience movie"": that is, a movie liable to be enjoyed chiefly by that absurdly unqualified demographic group - the audience. Like many such films, it does need the chemical reaction of a real-life crowd in the auditorium. Sisters is the kind of broad feelgood comedy that's made to look easy by Poehler and Fey, who breeze through the funny test and the Bechdel test and show that the female-female dynamic, so recently considered almost gravitationally impossible in comedy, works very well. Fey and Poehler get laughs with the smart, incorrect dialogue, their timing, the easy swing of their relationship, their ingrained song'n'dance relish for the material. They are masters of what the battle-hardened TV producer in the Peter O'Toole film My Favorite Year calls ""professional show-business comedy"". Fey and Poehler play two sisters, Kate and Maura, who have reached a state of anxiety in their lives. Kate is the party animal and single mom of exasperated teen daughter Hayley (Madison Davenport); she makes a precarious living doing people's hair, but after a disagreement with her employer she is now plying her trade freelance in the bathroom of the friend's apartment in which she is now crashing, using hair-dye materials that may not be entirely safe. Maura, on the other hand, is a nurse, a sobersides, a do-gooding community-minded person and the non-drinking ""designated mom"" at parties. The casting reverses the typecasting polarity you might expect of Fey and Poehler: it's pretty much the opposite of how they played in their film Baby Mama. But Pell's screenplay shows that despite being so different and having actually defined themselves in opposition to each other since their teenage years, these characters have an awful lot in common: loneliness and incipient melancholy. This is triggered when their elderly parents, played by James Brolin and Dianne Wiest, astonish them by announcing that they are selling the family home where they grew up, and downshifting to a retirement apartment to enjoy an easier and more affluent lifestyle. They are in fact unsentimentally impatient with their middle-aged children and are in the habit of ""fake-freezing"" on Skype to terminate long-distance calls. The daughters are brusquely informed they have just this weekend to take their teen mementos away before it all goes out with the trash. Pell's movie shows that this is not simply a matter of a few odds and ends: horrifyingly, the women's bedrooms are kept, shrine-like, exactly as they were when they were"
132,SJD_Doc2_Sisters,SJD_Doc2_Sisters,SJD,Comedy,Positive,Sisters,"#YouCanSeeThemBoth is the cheeky hashtag and tagline of ""Sisters,"" the Tina Fey-Amy Poehler comedy that dares to open on the same day as the cultural juggernaut that is ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens."" And you should see them both-as it turns out, they're not so different as they superficially may seem. Both films consistently entertain through a combination of snappy humor, crackling chemistry and heart, and both feature strong women at the center of a genre that men ordinarily anchor. ""The Force Awakens"" is ... well, it's a ""Star Wars"" movie. And ""Sisters"" is an all-night-raging-party movie, which traditionally has been the terrain of nerdy boys coming into their own and bawdy bros who have what's coming to them. So while you may think you've seen ""Sisters"" countless times before, it often feels refreshing and even pleasingly subversive through the sheer force of nature that is Fey and Poehler's well-established bond. Even when the film from director Jason Moore (""Pitch Perfect"") and writer Paula Pell gets a little repetitive and overlong, its radiant stars keep it engaging and lively. The former ""Saturday Night Live"" castmates and longtime friends operate on their own zippy, zingy wavelength; we know them well by now and we know their dynamic. But part of the allure of ""Sisters"" is the way it flips the roles they usually play-specifically, the roles they played in the 2008 comedy ""Baby Mama."" This time, Poehler is the responsible one as younger sister Maura, a divorced nurse living in Atlanta who's always taken care of everyone else at the expense of her own enjoyment and growth. Fey is the hot mess of an older sister, Kate, a hairdresser and single mom who selfishly has coasted on her smarts and sex appeal. When they learn that their parents (an adorably randy James Brolin and Dianne Wiest) are selling their childhood home in Orlando, FL-and that they have just a few days to clear out their stuff-they team up to throw one last, wild bash as both a celebration of their past and an effort to change their future. All the familiar pieces are in place as Maura and Kate prepare for their bacchanal: the rounding-up of random friends, the purchase of mass quantities of alcohol and snacks, the painstaking process of finding just the right outfit to wear. But it's the way ""Sisters"" goes about this series of steps that gives it some novelty and unexpected substance. The trying-on-dresses montage at a clothing store that's way too young for them is laughter-through-tears hilarious. Their spontaneous dance routine once the party gets into full swing-to Snow's ""Informer""-is a joy because they're so willing to embrace their goofiness. But there's also a core nugget of truth to these scenes that's fundamental to the whole movie. Returning to the house where they grew up-and to the bedroom they shared as little girls, complete with ""Xanadu"" and Michael J.

133,SJD_Doc3_Sisters,SJD_Doc3_Sisters,SJD,Comedy,Positive,Sisters,"Hooray. Yay. Yes. This. So much this. Women behaving badly. Women refusing to grow up. I mean, I would love it if The Movies reverted back to the days of Bringing Up Baby and The Thin Man, with men and women actually believing that 40something is cool, and dressing for dinner and having cocktails at six and solving mysteries and secretly aiding the resistance and such. But if that's not going to happen, and movies are going to be overpopulated by manchildren playing video games and ogling women and wallowing in haphazard celebrations of adolescent testosterone, then it's only fair that women get equal time and aren't expected to be the responsible ones while men have their fun. So hooray and yay for Sisters. Because now Tina Fey gets to be the womanchild: her teenaged daughter, Haley (Madison Davenport: Noah, Kit Kittredge: An American Girl), is more the grownup than she is, and she throws a for-real kicking-and-screaming tantrum, like a toddler, like an actual brand-new person who has not yet mastered bladder control, which is so absurd that you're convinced it has to be going extra lengths to be a joke, a sendup of how juvenile men are in films like this. Because now Amy Poehler gets to be self-centered and selfish in a uniquely feminine way; mini spoiler not really: it's about going overboard in being the ""good"" girl and the ""good"" sister and the ""good"" daughter and how damn self-congratulatory - and also self-negating, which for approved values of womanhood is allegedly a positive thing - that can be. And there's a particular sort of relief in seeing this notion of ""appropriate"" womanliness being sent up. Like: yes! Someone sees how ridiculous this is. Someone sees how not-positive for women this is. Someone sees how this is abdicating adulthood, not embracing it. (The someone is screenwriter Paula Pell, a Saturday Night Live veteran. And kudos to director Jason Moore [Pitch Perfect] for getting the tone just right.) Already Sisters has got it all over any Adam Sandler movie, which never sees how problematic 40something men behaving in stereotypically approved yet idiotically stupid ways really is. Not that the plot really matters, but Kate (Fey: Muppets Most Wanted, Admission) and Maura Ellis (Poehler: Inside Out, They Came Together) are the titular sibs who've just discovered that their parents (Diane Wiest [The Odd Life of Timothy Green, The Big Year] and James Brolin [Burlesque, The Hunting Party]) have sold their childhood home in Orlando, and they're angry with Mom and Dad for not even consulting them on this. As if it has anything to do with them! ""Spoiled brats,"" I thought, not kindly, and was afraid that the movie would agree with their entitlement. Hooray and yay, it does not. They get some pushback for their entitlement, which is more than Adam Sandler ever gets, but this is a good thing, and part of what makes Sisters worth your time: the women aren't unpunished, at least in a metaphysical"
134,SJD_Doc4_Sisters,SJD_Doc4_Sisters,SJD,Comedy,Positive,Sisters,"It's a testament to Amy Poehler and Tina Fey that Sisters is as consistently funny as it is. One can only cringe at the number of ways this film would have gone haywire in lesser hands. But it doesn't, and the movie hits more than it misses as Poehler and Fey, who could convincingly be real-life sisters at this point, entertainingly tread R-rated territory. Though light on plot and in need of a runtime haircut, Sisters is as rapid fire, energetic, and raunchy as any comedy this year. Poehler stars as Maura, a goody-two-shoes nurse. Her older sister, Kate (Fey), is impulsive, recently unemployed, and the mother to college-aged Haley (Madison Davenport), who's rapidly losing faith in her mom as a competent parent. After hearing that their own parents, Bucky (Brolin) and Deana (Dianne Wiest), are planning to sell the family home to downsize, the two race to Orlando to stop them. They're too late, left with nothing to do but clean out their old bedrooms. But then they formulate a crazy idea: invite all their old high school friends over and host one last throwback bash to their landmark parties of the late 1980's. Surprisingly enough, neither Poehler or Fey had a writing hand in Sisters. It feels like their fingerprints as all over it as writer Paula Pell packs in as many jokes as she can, with most of them drawing chuckles at minimum and belly laughs regularly. Director Jason Moore does have tendency to let mediocre jokes trail on far too long (an extended Scarface reference is flat bad). Fortunately, there's always something around the corner that works. A budding romance between Maura and the neighborhood handyman, James (Barinholtz), feels fresh and takes a completely hilarious and unexpected turn. Pell even works in a good amount of heart and reflection about how kids need to move on from their parents and not spend every waking hour worrying about them as they enter their senior years. The core plot is pretty thin, with the subplot about Fey's daughter barely even registering. But Sisters exists as a mile-a-minute joke machine, and in that capacity it succeeds. Poehler and Fey are both in top form, particularly Fey playing against-type as a foul-mouthed, wild, and youthful mother. The supporting cast is as good, led by dryly hilarious turns from James Brolin and Dianne Wiest as the girls' increasingly impatient parents. John Cena, appearing in his second hilarious comedy this year (Trainwreck), gets a lot of mileage out of his one-note drug dealer character. Maya Rudolph gets plenty of laughs on her own as a stuck-up realtor and former classmate. Ike Barinholtz, as the comedic straight man, keeps things on the level while playing a convincing love interest for Maura. Bobby Moynihan, as the socially awkward Alex, comes dangerously close to wearing out his welcome in the second act but gets funnier the more cocaine he does. Like most nearly-two-hour comedies, Sisters does run long in the tooth and curiously elongates some"
135,SJD_Doc5_Sisters,SJD_Doc5_Sisters,SJD,Comedy,Positive,Sisters,"Comedic sisters-in-arms, Amy Poehler and Tina Fey join forces yet again to bring us one of the funniest and crude comedies of the the 2015/16 summer season. Even though these comedy legends look nothing alike they are so fun in their own skin and working together you will seriously believe they are real sisters starring in SISTERS. The debauchery releases into Australian cinemas this Thursday January 6th from the peeps at Universal Pictures Australia. It runs for 118mins and is rated MA15+. Any Poehler is straight-laced Maura Ellis, a nurse who saves all her money, is responsible, owns a place and does all the right things but is alone and fairly isolated from a joyful social life. Her sister, Kate (Tina Fey) is the complete opposite, single mum running a beauty salon from her apartment because she keeps getting fired from her places of work. She never has money, loves to party and has never grown up from her college crazy years with no desire to forge a responsible life. Their retiree parents, played by the awesome James Brolin and Dianne Wiest, announce they are going to sell the family home, this basically crushes the girls who have to drive out to the family place and clean out their rooms and anything they want to keep. Back in the day the Ellis sisters were famous for their partying craziness and decide to have one last hurrah so invite all their old friends over for the party of their lives. Think a Sisterhood of the Bad Neighbours movie and you are on the money. This is NOT A CHICK FLICK although you and your lady friends should enjoy yourself A LOT. Put it this way, in a lot of scenes I laughed so much some pee came out, I can see teenage guys loving this as much as a Will Ferrell movie, better even. Following a dreadful opening twenty minutes when I thought this movie would be a walkout it gets into gear and when these two bounce off each other they tear it apart. They are bloody gold together. SNL writer, and friend to Poehler and Fey, Paula Pell, wrote this movie for the two of them alone, no one else would be playing these roles and no one else could pull it off, it would have been horrendous with anyone else in these roles. The jokes (once they start) are fast and non-stop and while about 25% percent of them fall on their ass the other 75% wins the movie and when a joke fails, who cares, within a minute another is there to make you pee yourself and forget. Pell has written this in a skit syle similar to SNL where individual skits work brilliantly but often times fail to bridge well in the ongoing narrative, but honestly, who cares, the skits are all you need to LOL. There is also some SNL alumni comedy friends in support roles that will make you LOL a lot. Bobby Moynihan"

As it is, it's a misfire barely saved by the endearing company of two genuine stars. While there's a drought of talented male comic performers in contemporary American cinema, their female counterparts have risen to the fore, with the likes of Lake Bell, Julia Louis Dreyfuss and Jenny Slate winning accolades for their recent turns in a slew of impressive indies. In the mainstream we have the duo of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, now as famous for their Golden Globe hosting gigs as for their long running TV sitcoms 30 Rock and Parks and Recreation. Fey and Poehler's small screen success has thus far failed to translate to the multiplex, and Sisters is yet another waste of their talents. As with her Parks & Rec character, Poehler's Maura is an uptight forty-something do-gooder here. Over skype, Maura learns that her parents (an under-used Dianne Wiest and James Brolin) have put the family home up for sale. This doesn't go down well with Maura's older sister Katie (Fey), who was hoping to move home due to financial trouble. While cleaning out their childhood bedroom, nostalgia kicks in and the duo decide to throw one final party in a bid to relive their teen years. For the first 30 minutes or so of Sisters I had a contented grin on my face, chuckling along to the film until it eventually reached a point where I realised I was simply coasting along on the energy of Fey and Poehler. The script, by SNL writer Paula Pell, is devoid of wit, and a mere two days after viewing the film I can't recall a single one-liner. What makes this more annoying is that Fey is herself a supremely talented comedy writer, as her work on 30 Rock and Mean Girls shows. As a performer, she brings a manic exuberance to her role that goes some way to papering over the cracks in the script, as does Poehler's likeable charm. That's not enough to sustain a movie that runs for two hours. Most of the film is an extended party sequence, one that takes a one scene joke from Trading Places and stretches it to snapping point. There are characters like John Cena's drug dealer who just stand around with nothing to contribute, and a prissy Game of Thrones addict played by Maya Rudolph, so poorly fleshed out that we're never sure if the film wants us to hate her or feel sorry for her. A flashback to the protagonists in their school years would have gone a long way towards providing some much needed context, and a glimpse at the cast list suggests such sequences were filmed but ultimately cut. That's an odd decision, as there's a hell of a lot of needless filler in the final cut that could"
137,SJD_Doc7_Sisters,SJD_Doc7_Sisters,SJD,Comedy,Negative,Sisters,"The chemistry between these two ""Saturday Night Live"" alumni is undeniable, even if this is only the second feature they have starred in together. Often it is their ability to play off of each other so effortlessly which allows us to believe they are sisters, far more than the actresses' ability to look like each other, and it is also what saves Sisters from an unfocused screenplay. If you ever thought that a ""SNL"" skit was funny until it repeated the same joke way past its welcome, you will have an idea of the type of approach Paula Pell takes in writing Sisters, with half of a lengthy 2-hour comedy centered on the joke that is middle-aged people partying like they are teenagers again. It is clear that Pell wrote this screenplay with many of these actors already in mind, but just because they play to their strengths does not make the material any more believable. It somehow feels like a group of ""SNL"" characters were unleashed onto the real world, but there aren't enough normal people to balance the absurdity of the quirks everyone in the cast has. At the center of the plot are the two title sisters played by Tina Fey (""30 Rock"") and Amy Poehler (""Parks and Recreation""), complete with shoehorned character arcs. Maura (Poehler) is the responsible sister, in a role that feels like a less joyous extension of her ""Parks and Recreation"" character, whereas Fey's Kate is an irresponsible sibling with a teenage daughter of her own (played by Madison Davenport) who is far more reliable. When Kate and Maura's parents (James Brolin, Dianne Wiest) suddenly sell their childhood home, the sisters decide to throw one last party before moving out their stuff. As infamous as their parties were in the past, Sisters forces the audience to endure the predictably contrived dullness of an adult party, mostly comprised of uncomfortable and uninteresting conversations. It isn't until their lesbian friends begin to DJ and an unconventional drug dealer (played by John Cena with little more than random single-premise jokes) arrives to spice up the party that the movie starts to build energy. This is also when all intelligence is banished from the screenplay, replaced by sophomoric slapstick and raunchy dialogue instead. There are some weak attempts at placing plot into the narrative during this extended party sequence. Maya Rudolph co-stars as a scorned former foe of Kate, desperate to be invited to one of the sisters' infamous parties, despite putting on a front of pretentious maturity. Kate also must learn to be more responsible over the course of the party, a much more difficult and forced idea to convey than Maura's attempt to loosen up with an attractive neighbor (Ike Barinholtz) she invites to the party. There are occasional moments of contrived character growth, peaking when Kate must conveniently use her former party skills to save her daughter from a sudden backyard sinkhole, though the natural tendency of Sisters is clearly irreverent silliness. There is"

I think that is the problem with this movie. Its stars are always ""on"". Tina Fey and Amy Poehler have received a hefty amount of critical praise for their Saturday Night Live and Golden Globe hosting performances. Fey especially for her dead-on impression of Sarah Palin, while Poehler didn't do so bad herself on Parks and Recreation. Maybe all of this praise has gone to their heads. Fey and Poehler approach Sisters seemingly believing that anything they do or say is funny because it is them saying or doing it. Comedies have mined all of the available humor that slapstick, bodily fluids, and bodily functions has to offer. No matter who is in front of the camera, funny material is needed. There are two genuine laughs in Sisters and neither Fey nor Poehler are responsible for them. There was once upon a time when someone impaling his rectum on a music box or floors collapsing might have been funny. That time has long passed. I don't want to sound like I have a giant music box (or stick) up my ass, but I am weary of this humor that appeals to the lowest common denominator. Sisters covers the same ground as many movies about a party spinning out of control. I think of Animal House (1978), which remains the superior party animal comedy. Why? As I reflect on it, the party scenes were funny because the humor came from the personalities and nature of the people attending it. Guys like Bluto, Otter, and D-Day weren't just performing stunts for the sake of performing them. They were extensions of their wacky personalities. Animal House also knew when to pick its spots. It didn't hurl verbal and physical humor at you at a relentless pace. It took time to slow down and rev up for the next big laugh. It allowed its characters to be characters. There was actually a subtlety in the midst of the lunacy. Sisters is about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the temple. Just to give a little background, Kate and Maura are sisters who are flabbergasted to learn that their parents have sold their childhood home. They fly to their hometown of Orlando and plan one last major bash before the house is sold to a snooty couple. This isn't a party like normal people would throw. This is clearly a movie party, where the supplies needed to pull off all of the sight gags would cost thousands of dollars. Since Kate is an out-of-work aesthetician and Maura is a nurse, I can not imagine how they could afford the seemingly endless amounts of food, booze, and drugs needed to keep about one hundred people acting like raving lunatics for hours on end. So what transpires at this bash that takes up nearly an hour of screen time?"

Their personas are wise but witty, harried enough to be relatable while together enough to be aspirational. In Fey's Liz Lemon on ""30 Rock"" and Poehler's Leslie Knope on ""Parks and Recreation"" they created television characters that seemed to define their cultural moment. And Fey and Poehler's brilliant three-peat hosting of the Golden Globes together and separate authoring of memoir/manuals cemented their public friendship and wide appeal. They seemed like people most anyone would want to spend time with. If only the new movie ""Sisters"" better satisfied the impulse to simply hang with Amy and Tina. Rather, as written by Paula Pell and directed by Jason Moore, the idea to apply the structure of a teenage best-night-ever party movie to a tale of middle-aged adults tends to smother its leads under comedic complications and unnecessary asides. The film would like to fashion itself as a tale of rediscovery and rebirth, allowing that at any age one can still start fresh, yet it repeatedly bogs itself down. This time out Poehler plays Maura Ellis, a caring, slightly controlling and somewhat recently divorced nurse who has often had to pick up the pieces for her chaotic older sister Kate Ellis, played by Fey. They have only one weekend to clean out the last of their things from the Orlando, Florida home they grew up in, as their parents (Dianne Wiest, James Brolin) are closing on a sale. The lead pair play with the roles established by their turn in 2008's ""Baby Mama."" Poehler's Maura has it together while Fey's Kate is a troubled mess. Even so, once the sisters decide to throw a blow-out party before leaving the house, the character dynamics flip again as Maura goes uncharacteristically wild for one night while Kate plays the role of the responsible one. The decisions work in favor of Poehler more than Fey. As Maura, Poehler gives a sense of her effusive, whirligig energy as well as the poignancy she often laced around Leslie Knope. Fey struggles to be believable as a troublemaker, working better in her more comfortable Liz Lemon register of frustrated and misunderstood, as when she blusters ""I am not a hothead, I am brassy."" The script is the feature film debut for longtime television writer Pell, which comes through in its episodic, strung-together structure. The movie is stuffed with familiar comedy faces, including Maya Rudolph, Ike Barinholtz, John Cena, John Leguizamo, Greta Lee, Bobby Moynihan, Rachel Dratch, Samantha Bee, Kate McKinnon, Jon Glaser and more. The kaleidoscope of personalities diffuses the central story. And as directed by Moore, who made the first ""Pitch Perfect,"" no opportunity is missed to detour the story with a music montage or dance break. The movie is also further proof of what should now officially be calculated as the Maya Rudolph Ratio, which is how the actress makes any movie she is in approximately 10-15 percent better.

I mean, through their celebrated time at Saturday Night Live to their post-late night days with 30 Rock and Parks and Recreation, both have shown themselves to be fun-loving ladies that work well with others. There's nothing like it when Fey and Poehler team up, though, so Sisters should have been a slam dunk, right? If the end result is less of a slam dunk and more of a two-pointer, it's at least better than their last pairing, the tepid Baby Mama from 2008. That film was highly anticipated but came off feeling like we were watching an extended SNL sketch with Fey playing her usual nerd-ish but noble lady and Poehler going big as a white trash pseudo-surrogate. In the ensuing years, Poehler and Fey have been reunited on several small screen occasions leading up to successfully hosting the Golden Globes three times, ruling over the festivities with their sly observances. And now we have another attempt at striking it rich on the big screen and while Sisters is markedly better than Baby Mama, it still winds up falling short of the packaged potential of its stars. This time, there seemed to be some real thought put into the piece, with Fey and Poehler wisely playing against type in bringing friend (and former SNL writer) Paula Pell's sorta biographical screenplay to life. When Maura and Kate's parents (Dianne Wiest, Parenthood and James Brolin, The 33) decide to sell the Florida home of their youth and move into a retirement complex, the sisters are tasked with cleaning out their room before the new family moves in. Maura (Poehler, Inside Out) is the responsible one, the sister that never got into trouble and was an eternal sober cab for her hard partying sister Kate (Fey, Admission). Upset with their parents for listing the lot without telling them, they decide to host one big party for their friends before they have to pack it in and move on with their lives. Kate promises to abstain from booze so Maura can let loose but as the night goes on the sisters find themselves plunked back into old habits, not always of their own free will. The film takes a while to get going and it mostly coasts along nicely. There's a charming romantic subplot with Maura romancing a hunky neighbor (Ike Barinholtz, heretofore not hunky) and it gives Poehler some nice moments, comedic and otherwise. Barinholtz should get some props here for dealing with a fairly nasty gross-out gag, one of several that occur during the night of increasing debauchery. Director Jason Moore (Pitch Perfect) knows when to let his stars do their thing but manages to keep control of the wild party that takes up the latter half of the film. Balancing a host of comedic players (like Horatio Sanz as that guy we all hate at parties and Maya Rudolph as a bitchy rival) with some third act emotional resonance is no"

A showcase for Witherspoon's dead-on comic timing, this new comedy is a slight and airy confection just perfect for the no-brainer summer months. Witherspoon stars as Elle Woods, an L.A. college senior who's ostensibly a fashion merchandising major, but her real goal is to become the wife of Warner Huntington III (Tigerland's Matthew Davis). When Warner abruptly dumps her-telling Elle that as a future senator he needs to ""marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn""-Elle conspires to win him back by following him to Harvard Law School and impressing him with her smarts. And how can Harvard resist Elle's hilarious video essay, in which she wears a spangled bikini and explains her qualifications for being a lawyer? Getting in to the school is one thing, but actually going to class and facing the professors (including a hilariously hard-ass Holland Taylor) is something else entirely. Spurred by rivalry with Warner's preppette fiancee Vivian (Selma Blair), Elle buckles down and starts making the grades, catching the eye of a professor (Victor Garber) who assigns her to help out with a murder case involving an exercise guru (Ali Larter) who, as luck would have it, is a sorority sister of Elle's. Legally Blonde has been getting lots of comparisons to Clueless because of its bimbo-with-a-brain heroine, but the film plays more like Private Benjamin-spoiled girl enters august institution for the wrong reasons, then rises to the occasion and develops character in adversity-with a dash of The Paper Chase thrown in for good measure. Writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (10 Things I Hate About You) keep things zippy with one-liners like ""Last week I saw Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal, and I talked her out of buying a truly heinous angora sweater. Whoever said orange was the new pink was seriously disturbed."" There's plenty here for gay audiences to chew on as well, from Meredith Scott Lynn's amusingly earnest dyke Enid (who recalls her undergrad organizing of the Lesbians Against Drunk Driving march as ""good times"") to the queer twists of the murder trial (involving designer shoes and a Cher tape). Alas, first-time director Robert Luketic (director of the award-winning short Titsiana Booberini) isn't always up to the task here: Once you get past Elle's dazzlingly dippy wardrobe (and her pink, faux-fur-covered phone), the movie doesn't have the visual oomph that this sort of comedy demands. There's also a big sequence involving Elle teaching her manicurist pal (Best in Show's Jennifer Coolidge) and a salon full of ladies (and male hairdressers) how to do the flirty ""bend and snap"" move, but the camera's never exactly where it ought to be to make this scene zing the way it should.

Legally Blonde isn't nearly as smart no talons underneath this Lee Press-On Nails production but it still makes for a giggly good time. Witherspoon plays sorority girl Elle Woods, recently dumped by her slick, eyes-on-the-Oval-Office boyfriend for being ""Marilyn"" material, and not the Jackie O. he needs to ascend to office. Undaunted, Elle applies (and is admitted) to Harvard Law School in order to impress her ex, who's also enrolled there. Of course, the powerfully pink Elle doesn't fit in with all those Harvard stiffnecks she's quickly dubbed Malibu Barbie by her classmates but her ingenuity and intuition land her a coveted internship at a law firm. There, she's called upon to solve a murder involving a fitness queen and former Delta Nu sister. When material is as intentionally ridiculous as this, there's a certain tacit suspension of disbelief. Moviegoers are allowed, even required, to turn off their bullshit radars: no squabbling over plot contrivances (of which Legally Blonde has many) or with characters who are simply caricatures of real life (with whom Legally Blonde is teeming). But even with that cushion, the film is still sloppily executed. The script, while loaded with some hearty laughs, simply takes jokes one step too far, like someone needling an elbow to your side, saying, ""Get it?"" The camerawork is unstirring, and first-time feature director Robert Luketic uses Southern California to stand in for Boston that, while very nice to look at, is lazily incongruous with Boston's actual changing seasons. (One dead giveaway: Elle looks out a window at some pretty [fake] snow falling no doubt concocted on an L.A. soundstage that is quickly followed by a lovely exterior shot of ""Cambridge"" in which the foliage shows barely a hint of fall's changing colors, and not a lick of snow to be had.) Nitpicky? Maybe. But the most criminal element of Legally Blonde is how underused the fine supporting cast is. The kookily comic Selma Blair (as a Harvard priss) is reduced to a drab, sulky, mulchlike thing. And Luke Wilson, looking more and more like Deputy Dawg, is wasted in another second-banana, boy-toy gig, following similar turns in Charlie's Angels and Dog Park. Legally Blonde gives him little to do than mug aw-shucks-like (to his credit, his ""aw-shucks"" could rival an early Jimmy Stewart in its earnest affability). So, with so much wrong how could Legally Blonde still come off meringue-pie right? That honor goes entirely to the priceless twitter and tart of Reese Witherspoon. She makes a throwaway character terrifically likable, and transforms a 90-minute, pretty dumb dumb-blonde joke into an hour and a half set for a comedienne coming into herself, further refining the snap-crackle-and-pop timing she first showed off in Alexander Payne's brilliant Election.

When she's dumped by her Harvard Law School-bound boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis) -- because she's too blonde to be considered seriously as wife material -- she fights back, nail by manicured nail, first by following Warner to Harvard Law School, then by proving that just because you're blonde doesn't mean you're a joke. The movie, however, is full of good humor. Based on the novel of the same name by Amanda Brown, and adapted for the screen by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (""10 Things I Hate About You,"" 1999), ""Legally Blonde"" is a sassy satire that retains a message: believe in yourself and follow your dreams. Besides being funny, it's an ode to self-empowerment -- especially girl power -- and its target audience of young women everywhere will gobble it up like the latest glossy edition of Cosmopolitan magazine. Elle isn't such an unlikely candidate for Harvard Law; she did have a 4.0 average as an undergraduate at the fictional CULA. (Of course, her major was fashion merchandising.) Moreover, she also has a very impressive background as homecoming queen and sorority president, her signature color is pink, and she's appeared in a Ricky Martin music video. Who could ask for anything more? She's an emblem of diversity! Naturally, she's accepted. Nothing will stop her now as she campaigns all over Harvard to win back her man. Call it blonde ambition. ""Legally Blonde"" becomes a ""blonde-out-of-water"" story as her snobby fellow law students begin taking bets on how long she'll last. Meanwhile, she discovers that Warner isn't worth all the effort. Succeeding in law school becomes a personal goal, and not merely a means to win back her shallow boy toy. She's a bubbly blonde with brains. Her points of reference may not be Plato and Socrates, but she proves that knowledge about Clinique, Porsches and lip gloss also can come in handy in a classroom or a courtroom. The supporting cast is a winning bunch. Selma Blair (a former Witherspoon costar in ""Cruel Intentions,"" 1999) is excellent as Vivian Kensington, a perfect bitch -- complete with pearls -- who has snagged Warner and is wearing his grandmother's six-carat Harry Winston diamond engagement ring on her ""bony"" finger. Luke Wilson (""Bottle Rocket"" 1996) plays Emmett Richmond, a somewhat thankless role as a third-year law student who falls in love with the inner woman beneath Elle's golden locks. And Jennifer Coolidge, most recently seen in 2000's ""Best of Show,"" turns in a touching performance as a middle-aged high school dropout manicurist befriended by Elle at a local beauty shop -- the only place where Elle feels at home when she first arrives in the Ivy League.

And while I'm not saying physiognomy is destiny, I do think that sharp, stubborn little Witherspoon chin has something to do with it: No matter how virginal or blithe she's supposed to be (in movies like ""Fear"" or ""Cruel Intentions""), her structural pointiness belies easy sweetness, suggesting the iron girder determination that supports her best performances, in movies like ""Pleasantville"" or, especially, ""Election."" To see Witherspoon daintily claw her way to success as the infernally perky Tracy Flick, candidate for student council president, in that triumphant antiblond manifesto, is to see a young actress in exciting control of her Clairol powers. In the likable lollipop comedy Legally Blonde, Witherspoon is flaxen to classic California girl specifications as Elle Woods, a West Coast campus princess who wafts through life on a cloud of privilege. Elle is rich, popular, and outfitted in the kind of predominantly pink clothes only the very fashion victimized or self confident would dare wear. But just when she expects to grab her big prize - a marriage proposal from her cute boyfriend, Warner (""Tigerland""'s Matthew Davis) - she's devastated to learn that her mealy beau, who has political ambitions and a place waiting for him at Harvard Law School, has no plans for a ""dumb"" blondie in his future. (His chosen fiancee, Elle soon discovers, is a pedigreed prune with a dank, brunet worldview, and she's wonderfully played by Witherspoon's ""Cruel Intentions"" costar Selma Blair.) The cheery, simple punchline of ""Legally Blonde"" is that dumbness has nothing to do with it: Don't hate Elle because she's beautiful, and don't dismiss this summer flick because it's not as hip to itself as ""Clueless"" or as well made as ""Election."" Sweetly intent on proving she's worthy of the lummox, Elle gets herself into Harvard Law School too, bowling the admissions committee over not so much with her transcript (although she does have good test scores) as with her admissions video (directed by ""a Coppola""). Elle not only makes it through law school, of course. She triumphs, winning friends and influencing people through a combination of glinting highlights, sturdy self confidence, and, it turns out, real brains packaged in silly clothes. I'd be happier for future scholars of hair color everywhere if screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (""10 Things I Hate About You"") took more risks and gave Elle more of a contour, making her either sharper or more rounded, or if first time feature director Robert Luketic messed with the unflaggingly light tone some more. Actually, I'd be happier if I had a little better idea of what really matters to Elle (besides turning lemons into lemonade).

It's the story of a sorority girl from Bel-Air who dresses in pink, wears Prada and goes to Harvard Law School. She goes because her boyfriend is there, and she wants him back. Reese Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, the focus of this culture-clash comedy, which contrasts the values of Harvard Law with those of a Southern California rich girl. The rich girl wins, hands down. ""Legally Blonde"" is on the side of glitz, tinsel and surface, but fortunately, Witherspoon is so innately likable that the film goes along pleasantly enough. It's pleasant, yes. Funny, no. Director Robert Luketic, in his feature debut, establishes Elle as a type. He saturates the screen with hot pinks and pastels and sees to it that the sun is always shining on her. But screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith do little with the type; nor do they find ways to develop her as a character. Elle remains a one-note joke, and while the joke provides a few laughs, it loses effectiveness. This is no ""Clueless,"" despite the Southern California heroine. ""Clueless"" was, first of all, funny. It was also something of a moral journey. Watching it, we understood that its heroine needed to learn something, to grow. This contrasts starkly with ""Legally Blonde,"" whose complacent acceptance of Elle as a moral exemplar limits the screenwriters' ability to write jokes and renders the movie lightweight. Elle talks like a chipper imbecile, but the movie assures us so often that Elle is brilliant that we start to wonder if it's protesting too much, and why. Invited to a Halloween party with students who regard her as a bimbo, Elle shows up in a Playboy bunny outfit, unwittingly presenting herself as the physical embodiment of their assumptions about her. Not very smart. Humor requires that comedian and audience share common values, but the values at work in ""Legally Blonde"" -- based on the book by Amanda Brown -- are, at times, bizarre. In one scene, students talk about how they spent their summer vacation. One ""dewormed orphans"" in Somalia, and another started the organization Lesbians Against Drunk Driving. The audience is expected not only to smile at their earnestness but also to regard their idealism as phony and self-deluding, a compensation for their dullness. At the same time, we're expected to see Elle -- who got into law school with an expensively produced admissions video -- as deserving of a Harvard education and of the power and privilege that will go with it. This is where it really pays to stop thinking about ""Legally Blonde,"" the film that dares to ask the question: Can a young woman overcome the burdens of wealth, privilege and beauty in her quest for fabulous power? It really does take gall -- or is it just obliviousness? -- to make an underdog out of a girl who lives ""across the street from Aaron Spelling."" Witherspoon's sunniness makes it all palatable, or"

When, as Beverly Hills-bred sorority girl Elle Woods, she shows up for her first day at Harvard Law School in a trim-fitting ensemble of pink pearlized leather, the only appropriate response is a heart-shaped sigh. If it's possible to play the essence of a perfume cloud -- an '80s classic like Yves St. Laurent's ""Opium,"" let's say -- Witherspoon does it in ""Legally Blonde."" When we first meet Reese's blond glamour-cutie Elle Woods it's the end of her senior year in college, and she's eagerly awaiting the ring and marriage proposal that she's sure her handsome, dull boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis) is about to deliver. He doesn't come through: He's on his way to law school, and he's hoping for a career in politics. ""If I'm going to be a senator, I need to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn,"" he explains matter-of-factly, delivering the line more to Elle's plunging neckline than to her face. First heartbroken, then determined, Elle decides that the best way to get Warner back is to get into law school herself. She has a 4.0 grade point average -- so what if it's in fashion merchandising? She puts on a sequined bikini for her admissions video, and somehow the old codgers at Harvard decide she might just be a complementary addition to their hallowed halls. When she arrives on campus, though, she realizes that no one takes her seriously because of the way she looks, least of all the haughty brunet prep Vivian Kensington (played by the marvelous Selma Blair), who, much to Elle's horror, has stolen Warner away over the summer. That means war: Elle sets out to prove her snooty classmates wrong and get her boyfriend back. The opening scenes of ""Legally Blonde"" (directed by Robert Luketic, making his feature debut) vibrate with a bubble-gum pink glow, and their cartoonishness is exhilarating. We see Elle in her sorority house, surrounded by a gaggle of giggling sisters, getting ready for her big date with Warner: None of these women are exactly rocket scientists, but Luketic doesn't hurl cheap jokes at them so much as bounce gags off them with a gentle ping. When it comes to humor, Luketic has a nice touch. He knows how to frame individual jokes so they're like little jewels. There's one particularly brilliant one-liner delivered by the always-funny Jennifer Coolidge (perhaps best remembered as Stiffler's mom in ""American Pie"") as Paulette, a friend the depressed Elle makes at a beauty parlor far outside the tweedy, upper-crusty confines of Harvard Square. I won't give it away here, but Coolidge delivers the joke with such offhanded insouciance that it seems to take a"
147,AEK_Doc7_LegallyBlonde,AEK_Doc7_LegallyBlonde,AEK,Comedy,Negative,Legally Blonde,"On July 13, 2001, MGM brought a breezy comedy to moviegoers nationwide, Legally Blonde. The film went on to gross more than $140 million globally and spawn a sequel. The Hollywood Reporter's original review is below: The good news is that there aren't nearly as many dumb-blonde jokes in Legally Blonde as one might expect. The bad news is there aren't too many jokes period. In another era, this film would have been called ""Tammy Goes to Law School,"" and the role of Elle Woods, well-played here by Reese Witherspoon, would certainly have gone to Debbie Reynolds or Sandra Dee. For this is a mild, somewhat sugary romantic comedy about a young woman with a perky personality who chases the man of her dreams to Harvard Law School only to discover she prefers the law to her knucklehead ex-boyfriend. Predictable, cutesy and surprisingly short on genuine humor, Legally Blonde gets by thanks to the magnetic presence of Witherspoon. The MGM pic should open well, but whether this Blonde has the shapely legs to sustain a long theatrical run in the heat of summer is doubtful. The film could have a modest success in video and cable markets. The perfunctory, implausible setup has Elle, a postfeminist girl with only marriage on her mind after graduation from a Los Angeles university, jilted by longtime beau Warner Harrington III (Matthew Davis). Determined to get elected to the U.S. Senate by age 30, this rich kid on his way to Harvard Law School can't afford the burden of a blond airhead for a wife. Only Elle, while blond, is no airhead. The movie swiftly establishes her as a smart woman but one whose priorities place clothing and nail and hair design far above, say, education or world events. (When a classmate claims to have spent the last two years in Bosnia, Elle remarks that that would explain her hairdo.) Against all logic, Elle immediately gets accepted into Harvard Law School, too - boy, that was easy. This sets up a cultural clash as Elle's signature pink - worn by her and her Chihuahua, Moonie - fails to jibe with the navy-blue blazer world of law school. Clothing certainly means everything in this movie as the filmmakers display a strong bias for blue-collar duds and exuberant flash over upper-class sartorial conservatism. Eager to get the movie out of classrooms and libraries, the second half plunges into an absurd storyline that has these first-year law students ditch their books to help a professor defend a woman charged with murder. Young Australian filmmaker Robert Luketic, directing his first feature and perhaps a little out of his depth, plays much of the comedy too broadly. But this undoubtedly springs from desperation as Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith's screenplay lacks any real humor. In Sandra Dee's time, Hollywood could portray innocence with a charming straightforwardness. Nowadays, the strain shows. Unwilling to give their heroine the bad habits and social faux pas of the titular character in Bridget Jones's"
148,AEK_Doc8_LegallyBlonde,AEK_Doc8_LegallyBlonde,AEK,Comedy,Negative,Legally Blonde,"One of the early morals that kids learn is ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" I can't attest to who first said that or whether it was ever really intended for discussing the selection of novels and other literary works by their covers or illustrated jackets. Of course, it's obviously intended as a bit of friendly and wise advice about not passing judgment on someone by their looks alone, especially in regards to certain stereotypical physical attributes. Although all types of people are subject to such typing - such as those of diminutive stature - women with fair or flaxen locks - favorably and negatively referred to as ""blondes"" - are often the recipients of most such treatment. We've heard that ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" and that ""blondes have more fun,"" but at the same time there's the connotation of bubbly and/or ditzy airheads, not to mention all of the ""dumb blonde"" jokes that are repeatedly passed on by both kids and adults. Considering much of Hollywood's view and treatment of women in films in general over the decades, it's not surprising that such stereotypes have been and continue to be perpetuated by various movies that use such characters as attractive set dressings and/or as fodder for such humor. Thus, it's always fun and often refreshing to see movies or characters that turn such stereotypes on their head, but don't do so in a political or preachy fashion. ""Legally Blonde"" is one such film featuring one such character, although the fair-haired protagonist in it both plays with and against such typing. If you can imagine Alicia Silverstone's high school character in ""Clueless"" graduating and attending law school only to find herself faced with certain plot elements lifted from ""My Cousin Vinny"" and any other ""small time, unorthodox lawyer saves the day via their innate knowledge"" films, then you pretty have this extremely lightweight but generally amusing and cute film. As directed by Robert Luketic (who's making his feature film debut) and written by screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith - the latter of whom are obviously hoping to have lighting strike twice after their well received and witty debut effort, ""10 Things I Hate About You"" - the film starts off with a fun bang. The bubbly and vivacious protagonist - who's led a charmed and privileged existence so far - finds her life turned upside down when her boyfriend dumps her, not because she's ugly or he's found someone else, but because in his eyes she's too much of a stereotypical blonde who could ruin his political future. She's naturally devastated and thus has the necessary motivation to try to win him back and later prove him wrong about his stereotypical beliefs about women who look and act like her. While that premise opens the floodgates of comedic potential and eventual, humorous comeuppance, as she must prove she's not a dumb blonde to succeed in both endeavors, the filmmakers don't mine the material as thoroughly or deeply as"
149,AEK_Doc9_LegallyBlonde,AEK_Doc9_LegallyBlonde,AEK,Comedy,Negative,Legally Blonde,"Legally Blonde fits into the niche occupied by motion pictures like Clueless, Dick, and Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion - that is to say, films in which an airhead heroine captures our affection and overcomes her vacuous disability to triumph. However, while Legally Blonde boasts its share of cute moments, the production has at least one significant problem - the plot. Director Robert Luketic's feature debut is handicapped by a lame, predictable storyline that calls attention to itself too often. Admittedly, in all but the best comedies, plot is usually not a strong suit, but the filmmakers of Legally Blonde make the mistake of believing the audience will care about the way things progress, which is not likely to happen. Without question, Reese Witherspoon carries the film. The actress, who has basically grown up in front of the camera, has previously shown a strong grasp of both comedy and drama, and this is the most effective satirical performance she has given since Election. Witherspoon's character, Elle Woods, is on screen for a majority of the running time, and it's worth noting that the movie wouldn't have been as watchable with a less capable actress in the lead role. It takes a talented performer to make a dumb character likeable (as opposed to irritating). When Legally Blonde opens, Elle has just finished a highly successful four years at college, where she majored in fashion, was president of the Delta Nu sorority, and appeared in a Ricky Martin music video. Now, as she prepares to enter real life, she is expecting a proposal from her boyfriend, Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis). What she gets, instead, is the kiss-off. Warner is headed for Harvard Law School, and doesn't want to be encumbered by a California girl. He intends to be a U.S. Senator by the age of 30, and, for that to happen, he needs the ""right kind"" of wife, and she's not Elle. Undeterred, our heroine decides to follow Warner to law school, and, after preparing an unorthodox admission essay and doing surprisingly well on the LSATs, she is accepted. Once at Harvard, she sets out not only to win Warner back from his new, snooty girlfriend, Vivian (Selma Blair), but to prove that she can become a lawyer. Legally Blonde combines three plot staples: the triumph over adversity, the romantic comedy, and the courtroom comedy. The resulting uneven confection is sporadically affable, but the movie suffers because it never attempts to push the envelope or challenge its boundaries. The production targets teenagers (girls more than boys) who are content to watch a motion picture with a few laughs and a happy ending. For every sly or barbed comment, there are a dozen missed opportunities. Legally Blonde wants so desperately to be liked by everyone (even lawyers, whom it jokingly calls ""people who are boring, ugly, and serious"") that it takes pains to neuter its insults. For much of the first two-thirds, Legally Blonde remains within the realm of mild satire"

She's also preparing to receive an heirloom engagement ring from her East Coast boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis, ""Pearl Harbor""). She's shaken to her core when she discovers that instead, he's breaking up with her, as she's just not 'serious' enough for a future senator. Elle's mettle is up, so she gets a Copolla to direct a video essay and gets accepted to Warner's school. Harvard Law has never seen the likes of Elle Wood, but they turn out to be a surprisingly compatible combination in ""Legally Blonde."" ""Legally Blonde"" is essentially ""Private Benjamin"" goes to law school, with liberal dashes of ""Clueless"" thrown in. Although Reese Witherspoon has charm to spare, first time feature director Robert Luketic, armed with an adapted screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (""10 Things I Hate About You""), serves up a film that lacks focus. Elle, with her California couture, pink pumps and color-coordinated chihuahua Bruiser, is out to dispel the dumb blonde stereotype without toning down her wardrobe. But she receives a double shock her first day at school, which is a lot tougher than she had expected (surrounded by black lap tops, Elle brings out a heart-shaped notepad and pink feather pen). She's ejected from her class by preppie Vivian Kensington (Selma Blair, ""Cruel Intentions"") and then discovers that Vivian's wearing Warner's family rock. An emergency manicure at the Beauty Oasis, where she meets pathetic Paulette (Jennifer Coolidge, ""Best in Show""), gives her a boost, though, and she decides to stick it out. After some advice from third year student Emmet (Luke Wilson, ""Charlie's Angels""), Elle counters Warner's thoughts on the parental rights of sperm donors by comparing masturbation to reckless abandonment and captures the attention of Professor Callahan (Victor Garber, ""Titanic""). Soon she, along with Warner and Vivian, are interning on a murder case. It's here that ""Legally Blonde"" begins to go seriously astray. The young fitness wife of a wealthy older man accused of murdering him turns out to be an alumnus of Elle's California college. The creaky plot mechanics don't hold a lot of laughs and take the focus away from Elle's plan to win back Warner. The romantic possibilities of pairing Elle and Emmett aren't explored and Vivian's scheme to show up Elle at a party is a visual joke done months ago in ""Bridget Jones's Diary."" Still, Reese Witherspoon shines as the perky, pampered blonde, injecting the film with so much good will it's hard to dislike it. Moonie the chihuahua is a great find as Bruiser, a natural extension of Elle Woods' persona. No one else in the cast, with the exception of Brooke Taylor as tough as nails Professor Stromwell and Oz Perkins as Dorky David, really offers much. Raquel Welch has a flamboyant cameo as the murder victim's first wife. Production design by Melissa Stewart (""To Die For"") and costume design by Sophie de Rakoff"

I can't be the only one who's been craving a good old-fashioned treasure hunt, where the leads throw sparks and the ladies' makeup never smudges, no matter how close to the volcano they get. After a long stretch without such a big-screen Hollywood adventure movie (at least, not one without ties to a video game or theme park ride), ""The Lost City"" makes for welcome counter-programming. The story was producer Seth Gordon's idea, but credit siblings Adam and Aaron Nee (who tested the waters with their Mark Twain-inspired ""Band of Robbers"") for sprucing up the formula, while Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum supply the chemistry. Bullock plays brainy romance novelist Loretta Sage, who's lost her inspiration since the death of her husband, an archaeologist who might have been onto something. Her once-scorching potboilers barely simmer these days, and she's seriously thinking of killing off Dash, the long-haired, Fabio-looking Lothario who graces the covers of all her books. She can hardly stand Alan (Tatum), the dum-dum male model who embodies Dash, dismissing him as a mouth-breathing ""body wash commercial."" But Alan's a hit with the ladies at book-signing events, and lucky for her, he sorta-kinda likes Loretta - enough to go traipsing halfway across the Atlantic after she's kidnapped by a wealthy weirdo named Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). A billionaire with an insecurity complex, Fairfax is convinced that Loretta knows the location of the Crown of Fire, a long-lost diamond headdress described in her latest book, and he flies her to a remote tropical island to help him find it. Maybe then Daddy will love him. Alan, who isn't the brightest, has the wisdom to enlist an old acquaintance, lethal ex-Navy SEAL Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt), who typically works solo. But Alan insists on tagging along, and together these two dreamy dudes follow the signal from Loretta's watch to the middle of the Atlantic, where Abigail has located the ""Lost City of D."" To Alan's chagrin, Loretta seems a lot more interested in Jack once she's rescued, although the adventure's only just begun. (Pitt, who provides the kind of scene-stealing cameo Tatum did in last summer's ""Free Guy,"" doesn't stick around for long.) Free from captivity but still stuck on the island, Loretta realizes that maybe she could figure out where the Crown of Fire is hidden. Pursued by Abigail's henchmen, she and Alan make their way through the jungle, navigating nearly all the usual pitfalls of the genre - minus bone-in-the-nose natives. ""The Lost City"" evokes movies that can seem outrageously insensitive when revisited today, while avoiding the most wince-inducing cliches. One reason I've been craving a fresh ""Romancing the Stone""-like movie is that I happened to revisit the original during the early days of COVID and winced at the overtly racist stereotypes (not to mention the"
152,CLF_Doc2_LostCity,CLF_Doc2_LostCity,CLF,Comedy,Positive,Lost City,"The Lost City stars Sandra Bullock (Loretta Sage) and Channing Tatum (Alan) as a romance novel author and her cover model. Already sounds hilarious doesn't it? The movie starts out with a book tour that certainly has its fun moments, but the real adventure comes when Daniel Radcliffe's Abigail Fairfax kidnaps Loretta to hunt down a priceless artifact. Why would a novelist have the skills to help him? Because of course she used to go on expeditions with her late husband, and even translated some writings inside her romance novels, which feature exotic adventures. Much like all romantic comedies, The Lost City is quite predictable - however, it is a really fun ride from start to finish. This rom-com is unique in that it also includes a lot of great action scenes. Brad Pitt plays Jack Trainer who is hired to rescue Loretta alongside Alan, and while he isn't in the film for a particularly long time, he certainly gives a great impression. He is no virgin when it comes to action scenes, and his rescue scene is one of the best in the film. The CGI might not be perfect, but the explosions are pretty cool. One of the biggest issues with this movie is that the trailers show the best parts. This causes the majority of the rest of the comedy and action to fall a bit flat. For those who did not get to see this in theaters and had to wait until the at home release, That said, I can see how this would be a much better experience with a large audience in a movie theater, on the big screen. The Lost City is a feel good, romantic comedy, and comedies are always better with a group of people to laugh at it with. This isn't to say the movie isn't funny, because it is. It just seems like the majority of the best scenes were shown in the marketing for the movie. This makes The Lost City all that more predictable. Tatum and Bullock are fantastic together though, which took me a bit by surprise. Some of the best moments are when just these two are on screen. Thanks to the incredible acting chops they both have, their relationship is very believable. It feels earned as the story goes on, which all too often these relationships don't. Even though these two are fantastic, they aren't the actor who steals the show. It is Radcliffe's Abigail that is the stand out. It is very obvious that he is having the absolute time of his life in the role, which makes him a really fun villain. His temper tantrums are hilarious, and you can't help but feel bad for him every once in a while. He also has some of the best lines in the entire movie (listen up when Tatum is on the roof of a vehicle... trust me). Overall this movie is a whole lot of fun. It is cute, silly, and packed with"
153,CLF_Doc3_LostCity,CLF_Doc3_LostCity,CLF,Comedy,Positive,Lost City,"There is a group of films that fit within the 'romantic-comedy' genre that I think you may have watched before. This is where two people not in a couple are dropped into a life-or-death situation and must learn how to get along with each other or more by the time the film has finished. They can be good like Romancing the Stone and My Fellow Americans, and well, they can be not so good. Today, we are looking at a film that hits all the main points of this world and manages to shine due to a cast committed to the chaos. So to set the scene, Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is a prevalent romance author. However, she has been stuck with writer's block since her archaeologist husband passed away. She put together a new book for her agent Beth Hatten (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), but her heart was not in it, and even less so in the book tour that she had to go on to promote it. Sensing this, Beth asks the popular model Alan Caprison (Channing Tatum), who has been the cover model for all of Loretta's books, to come along to boost attendance at the events. That also goes poorly, but as Lorretta is leaving, she is kidnapped by reclusive billionaire Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). For you see, as an undergrad, Loretta was an expert in a small Indigenous people's group in the Atlantic and incorporated that work into her novel. Abigail is after a lost treasure from those people, and Loretta might be the only one who can help him. To be honest, I didn't know what to expect when I walked in to watch this film. Many films that have dabbled in this area recently, like Uncharted, had left me feeling disappointed, but there was a strong cast behind this work. What I got was a surprisingly fun watch from start to finish. Indeed, it was nice to just laugh for a couple of hours in a fun romp through the jungle. However, I must say that the flagrant destruction of cheese was distressing. The reason this film works as well as it does is in that cast. Everybody knows what type of film they are in and plays to that angle. This decision gives the film a levity that makes every moment a delight. Sandra Bullock just owns every moment she is in. She always lands her mark from the fish-out-of-water moments to the romp-through-the-forest moments. Channing Tatum plays into a fictionalised persona of what many people think he is. This only works because Channing is clearly in on the joke, so he can make it work no matter the extreme. Indeed, one of the film's best parts was the chemistry between the two leads. Supporting we have Daniel Radcliffe and Da'Vine Joy Randolph, who make every scene better by being there. Indeed, even though this is a pretty standard narrative, the cast makes it shine.

It's an apt cliche: She plays Loretta Sage, the author of a series of popular romance novels; he's Alan, the stud whose ripped chest and Fabio wig have helped sell her paperbacks to millions of happy readers. To Loretta, Alan is an incompetent himbo with delusions of grandeur and certainly the last fool she'd want to be stuck with on a wild and crazy jungle adventure. But like a lot of Tatum characters (see the ""Magic Mike"" and ""21 Jump Street"" movies - seriously), he turns out to be smarter, deeper and more genuinely heroic than she expects. So sure, don't judge a book by its cover. I should note, however, that I may have committed an equivalent offense when I opted to check out ""The Lost City"": The poster made it look kind of fun, and lo and behold, it is. It helps that the pairing of Bullock and Tatum - now that sounds like a law firm I'd hire, or at least a hoity-toity restaurant I'd eat at - is as delightful as you'd expect from two actors of such goofy charm and combustible energy. It also helps that the directors, Aaron and Adam Nee (""Band of Robbers""), have tailored this unapologetically derivative vehicle to their stars' easygoing chemistry, taking what might have been a strained, clanging excuse for a mainstream action-comedy and investing it with, if not big belly laughs, then at least a refreshing sweetness of spirit. This may sound like a strange thing to say about a movie in which the male lead gets spattered with human viscera and attacked by blood-sucking leeches (though not, thankfully, in the same scene). But I'm getting ahead of the plot, which is a pleasant mix of the familiar, the preposterous and the familiarly preposterous. Along with their co-writers, Oren Uziel and Dana Fox, the brothers Nee have rearranged the sturdy bones of ""Romancing the Stone,"" Robert Zemeckis' 1984 adventure starring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. Once again a pulp novelist finds herself lost in a distant jungle thanks to some treasure-hungry ne'er-do-wells, and once again a not-entirely-trustworthy man comes to her ostensible rescue. This variation on the formula has fewer crocodiles and more explosions; it also has a bonus extended cameo by Brad Pitt, briefly and amusingly sending up his own guy's-guy nonchalance. The two lead roles have also been deftly customized, both to reflect a more 21st-century gender dynamic and to accommodate the yin-yang mix of Bullock's smarts and Tatum's sensitivity. Loretta may be a popular writer, but she also despises her work and most of her readers; she's a serious-minded archaeologist by trade (so, sniff, was her late husband) with a specialty in dead languages. This (sort of) explains why she's suddenly kidnapped, mid-book tour, by Alistair Fairfax (a very good Daniel Radcliffe), a wealthy media baron with a Murdoch-scion"

Being a trouper, Loretta suits up into her uncomfortable glittery purple jumpsuit (it's on loan) and begrudgingly puts on a fake smile onstage next to Alan (Channing Tatum), the well-meaning but dimwitted (and yes, hot) himbo cover model who portrays the hunky leading man of Loretta's books, Dash McMahon. As if leaving her house in the first place weren't bad enough, Loretta is mysteriously kidnapped by Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe), the psychotic child of a billionaire media mogul locked in a Succession-like feud with his more successful siblings. Somehow, it gets even more twisted: Abigail is hellbent on discovering the ""Crown of Fire"" in the middle of a remote Atlantic island, and believes Loretta is the only one who can decipher the treasure map. Secretly in love with her, Alan hops on a plane and enlists the help of Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt) to rescue Loretta from Abigail's monied clutches, deep within the jungle. While the explosive, action-packed sequences are a lot of fun, and an essential element of the adventure genre, what sets The Lost City apart from recent, more tired blockbuster adventure/comedy fare (looking at you, Uncharted) is the humorously human moments that lead to a genuine connection between Loretta, Alan and the audience. Instead of falling back on the kind of semi-ironic ""so, that happened"" style of fourth-wall-breaking writing, directors and co-writers Adam and Aaron Nee take familiar adventure/rom-com cornerstones and repurpose them to find previously undiscovered gems through these personal moments. They are certainly aware of the tropes being toyed with here-dumb guy/smart lady romance, the frame story of Loretta's novels, the treasure-hunting villian-but they approach these tropes with a freshness that gets the audience invested in its characters. The choice to play Alan as a loveable dummy with a surprising amount of tender insight is much more interesting than the usual emotionally repressed macho action hero, or a sarcastic know-it-all rolling his eyes and winking at the audience. Not only is it funny watching Alan fumble his way through the jungle, it's also endearing when he reveals himself to be more than what Loretta sees on the surface. What Alan lacks in street smarts, he makes up for in emotional intelligence and a gentle spirit; Tatum isn't afraid to play that for laughs, either. ""Don't judge a book by its cover model,"" he tells Loretta by the fire. This adage also applies to audience perceptions of the film overall: Don't be too quick to turn your nose up at The Lost City because of its blockbuster gloss and trite trailer, for so many treasures await beneath the surface.

To me, it felt like it started off as a prank, where one of them might have suggested an idea of roping in Brad Pitt for a super-cool cameo as a sexy, undercover guy named Jack Trainer in what would essentially be an unofficial remake of Robert Zemeckis' gleefully pulpy but wholly watchable action-adventure ""Romancing the Stone."" Then, they might have decided to cast the super-dashing Channing Tatum to play out an extension of his dumbfoolery from the Jump Street movies, and Sandra Bullock as well, Sandra Bullock from all her 90s movies. The result would make a fairly entertaining movie that would glide along on their chemistry alone. However, what we do get here is an over-stretched, unfunny, and terribly written film that doesn't know if it wants to be a treasure hunt adventure, a reworking of the damsel in distress trope, a moving-on from a grief tale, or a rom-com that ends with a kiss. Anyway, Bullock stars as Loretta, a reclusive novelist who writes these pulpy treasure hunting adventures that are less treasure hunting and more of a sexually charged romance between Angela and Dash (the main characters from her book). We meet her first in the midst of her frustration as she dodges her agent Beth's (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) calls to finish the final chapter of her new book. We get to know that it has been 5 years since her husband passed away, and instead of moving on, she has decided to limit her interactions. This is why, a book tour that involves interacting with people in a body-hugging-sparkly-jump-suit-dress, has to be the last place she wants to be. However, when there, we also meet Dash (basically Channing Tatum's Alan donning fake blond hair), who apparently has a thing for her, but is unable to connect because of a sort of intellectual shield that Loretta has built around her. Alan, who considers himself dumb is unable to traverse around that. But, before things could get sex-cringe, Loretta is kidnapped by some hoodlums who apparently work for Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). Please note that this character makes sure to tell us that this is a gender-neutral name and that you are not allowed to make fun of it (Me: It's 2022, and no one is making fun of it anymore). Anyway, Abigail tries to reason with Loretta about a piece of key information in her book that might help him find some sort of hidden treasure, but Loretta, who has left reading cryptic messages since her husband died, is reluctant and uptight. So, our baddy decides to drug her (note that this character likes cheese for no reason whatsoever) and fly her to the middle of the Atlantic.

That is the great promise of The Lost City (in theaters March 25), which features Sandra Bullock as a frustrated, but successful, romance novelist and Channing Tatum as the dreamboat who has posed for all of her steamy book covers. What a gas! The Lost City has a funny shape to it. On the one hand, its programmatic setup-familiar to fans of Romancing the Stone or (to a lesser extent) Raiders of the Lost Ark-feels easy, like it's built on fast rails. Yet in that assumption of ease lies a difficulty. An airy star vehicle like this takes a lot of work, but shouldn't look like it does. Unfortunately, The Lost City (directed by Adam and Aaron Nee) seems exhausted by its task from the outset. Bullock plays Loretta, who is struggling to finish the latest book in her hot-and-throbbing romance-adventure series, gloomy from the loss of her husband and sour about the state of her work. She's an intellect who should be off making great discoveries with her archeologist husband, not stuck pandering to the middling American masses. Bullock is good at such prickly discomfort, but a little of it goes a long way. In The Lost City, though, she's asked to maintain that dyspepsia for nearly the entire run of the film. It's a single, relentlessly repeated note that weighs down a film that should bounce, not trudge. (At least Bullock's high aptitude for physical comedy is put to good, if too brief, use.) Perhaps the calculation was that Tatum, as dopey Alan, would add the goofiness and levity necessary to offset Bullock's peevishness. He tries to do that, and he and Bullock's chemistry does sometimes sparkle and fizz enough to keep the movie afloat. But we've also seen this shtick from Tatum perhaps too many times before: the hunk who's actually a guileless sweetheart, a dork in himbo packaging. His decency is so immediately telegraphed in the film that there's no room for the happy surprise of a character turn. What could rescue, or at least brighten up, these uninspired performances is a remotely engaging story. But The Lost City flounders in that arena as well. The gist is that something Loretta wrote in her newest novel accidentally syncs up with an I.R.L. search for a lost bauble of old, rumored to be buried somewhere on a remote island in the Atlantic. (I think its closest real-world analog would be a distant Canary Island.) Daniel Radcliffe gamely plays the jilted son of a Murdoch-esque media empire who has become obsessed with finding this object of myth. So obsessed, in fact, that he's willing to kidnap Loretta to help in his search. Alan goes bumbling after Loretta"
158,CLF_Doc8_LostCity,CLF_Doc8_LostCity,CLF,Comedy,Negative,Lost City,"I have a confession to make: I have never warmed up to Sandra Bullock as a star. It isn't that I haven't enjoyed her presence onscreen. It's just that on her own, she doesn't feel like a supernova; she dims or brightens by virtue of whom she is acting against. When it's Keanu Reeves? That's when she truly shines, in movies like 1994's Speed, where her determination and wit perfectly flirt with Reeves's doting machismo. (I even have a soft spot for their dynamic in the admittedly weird 2006 romantic drama, The Lake House.) She has the appropriate charm in Miss Congeniality, a 2000 film that again highlights her prickly steadfastness while giving her physical comedy alongside seasoned scene partners like Michael Caine and Candice Bergen. In 2013's Gravity, her drive is so well-harnessed that the chemistry she cultivates with George Clooney persists long after he disappears. But as an unyielding matriarch in The Blind Side, a 2009 film built on baldly uncomfortable racial politics that garnered her a Best Actress Oscar, she fails to feel whole or engaging. As the supposed center of the film, she lacks any force beyond curdling white saviorism. The Lost City, released this weekend, is the kind of film meant to rest on the laurels of star power. Not just Bullock's, but her immediate cast members', too. The film - which scans as Romancing the Stone cosplay updated for the current moment - is the kind of romantic action-adventure caper we haven't seen in decades. It doesn't waste time. At a fleet 92 minutes, the film dives into a story about Loretta Sage (Bullock), a highly successful romance novelist whose life has been defined by loneliness since the death of her beloved husband. Her apparent knowledge of a lost city - reflected in her swooning recent book - gets her kidnapped by a madcap, disgruntled billionaire (Daniel Radcliffe) who believes she can locate the priceless treasure he's been spending oodles of cash to find. Loretta proves to be more capable than her captors realize, and she's not alone - the sweet himbo who models on her covers, Alan (Channing Tatum), sets out to save her, leading to high jinks and, theoretically at least, romantic sparks set against the backdrop of a dangerous jungle on a forgotten island. ""The movie comes with an additional set of stakes specific to Hollywood's post-pandemic future,"" the New York Times' Kyle Buchanan posits. ""As the theatrical business constricts, will people still go see an old-fashioned comic adventure where the actors lack any superpowers besides A-list charisma?"" Here's the problem. The Lost City may have the A-listers, but it doesn't possess the craft necessary to spotlight their skills. Audiences shouldn't be blamed if they are cold to the film. How can we expect people to respond to adult movies like this if they lack the charm of the genres they're plundering for inspiration? The Lost City isn't terrible, just aggressively mediocre. It is the kind of movie you put on"
159,CLF_Doc9_LostCity,CLF_Doc9_LostCity,CLF,Comedy,Negative,Lost City,"Sandra Bullock looks stunning in the middle of the jungle, and Channing Tatum shows his softer side in The Lost City. But those are the biggest-and perhaps only-takeaways from the new comedy-action movie. The movie, released in theaters on March 25, offers nothing unique. In fact, you get the sensation that you've already watched it a million times. It's the typical adventure movie where the two main characters fall in love after fighting for their lives in the wilderness. From the beginning, it was obvious that The Lost City would not be a revolutionary or award-winning movie, but it doesn't even get any redeeming points for being funny. The audience forgets the few moments worthy of laughter because they are overshadowed by the painfully unfunny scenes throughout the entire movie. Bullock plays Loretta, a recently widowed, burnt-out romance novelist and former archaeologist. She is sinking in grief, unable to form connections with the people around her or to carry on with her career as an author. In an effort to sell her book of the same title as the movie, Loretta's marketing team advises her to appeal to a young audience. This young audience is a superficial fanbase that's more interested in Alan (Tatum), the sexy man on the cover of her book who plays the hero of her novel, than the actual content of her work. Loretta is well-spoken and knowledgeable in archaeology, but she is frustrated because her readers dismiss these traits. Her frustrations led her to become arrogant and ungrateful both to her fanbase and to the viewer. She thinks very little of Alan, believing he is shallow and vain because he is confident and attracts lots of women. But Alan's character is charming beyond his physical attractiveness. His character surprises the viewer by demonstrating depth and complexity after his first seemingly shallow appearance in the movie. Although Alan fits the archetype of a himbo at first, he is much more than that. He is caring, thoughtful, and in touch with his emotions. Loretta, on the other hand, puts little effort into the things she does and says and goes along with anything her marketing team says, showing her lack of personality and ambition. During her book tour, Loretta is kidnapped by Abigail (Daniel Radcliffe), a bizarre, wealthy man. The movie turns into a rescue mission that Alan orchestrates to find Loretta. The plot is disorganized and sloppy. It includes a few poorly executed action and fight scenes that are predictable for the genre and therefore uninteresting. The brief appearance of Brad Pitt as Jack Trainer shows the directors' dependency on a renowned cast to make a noticeable movie. Pitt appears out of nowhere to fight the bad guys in the movie and does not add much more than that. The Lost City could've been funny if it wasn't trying so desperately hard. When it tries to be funny through sarcasm, it overdoes the sarcasm to an obvious and awkward point. In the opening scene of the"
160,CLF_Doc10_LostCity,CLF_Doc10_LostCity,CLF,Comedy,Negative,Lost City,"""The Lost City"" is a big mess - a big enough mess that it doesn't even get credit for knowing it's a mess - but it stars Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum, so that helps. It doesn't make it worth seeing, but it keeps the experience outside the realm of pain. Yet in one way the casting actually hurts: When actors who are really, really good at comedy apply themselves to dialogue that is really, really weak, you feel the strain. You feel the outline of the joke that wasn't there - and the vicarious embarrassment of a failed acrobatic turn that goes splat. String enough splat moments together, and you have a movie that could have been good, but isn't. The setup is fine. Bullock is Loretta, a romance novelist who has become reclusive since her husband's death. On a tour for her latest book, one she doesn't even like, she is paired with Alan (Tatum), a model who has appeared on the cover of all the books in her celebrated series. At this point, the Fabio-like model has more fans than Loretta, and Tatum is funny, tossing his (wigged) long blond hair and preening for his fans. One gets the sense that if the story just found a way to stay there, on that tour, the movie would have found its way to something enjoyable. But then the plot kicks in. A spoiled and somewhat demented young scion of the Fairfax media empire (Daniel Radcliffe) - these days, every evil character is a fictional rendition of someone from the Murdoch family - approaches Loretta with a proposition. Because of her knowledge of ancient languages, he wants her help finding the buried treasure of some lost civilization. That's a reasonable offer. He needs help translating clues to the treasure, and he's willing to pay her anything she asks. But she says no, so he kidnaps her and brings her to the island anyway. It would be missing the point of a movie like this to quibble too much about illogical turns of plot. But even in a goofy confection like ""The Lost City,"" it's hard not to notice when characters consistently behave against their own best interests, seemingly to help the screenwriters perpetuate the story. Over and over - I'd describe this in detail, but it wouldn't be worth reading - the characters are shoehorned into actions that don't make sense and that undercut both the story and the comedy. The movie has two bright spots. Brad Pitt makes a brief appearance as the man who can get them off the island. Bullock asks him how he happened to become so handsome and he answers, ""My father was a weatherman."" Bullock and Tatum also have a funny moment, right after they accidentally force two bad guys on motorcycles to go off a cliff. In what plays like an ad lib, the two start finishing each other's sentences, talking guiltily about how they didn't really mean for that to happen."
161,TJH_Doc1_NoTimeToDie,TJH_Doc1_NoTimeToDie,TJH,Action,Positive,No time to die,"Now he's come to the end of his run, Daniel Craig's James Bond will be remembered as the first - and possibly only - 007 to grieve so intensely and for so long over a woman. Back in the beginning, the idea of Sean Connery doing such a thing would have been unthinkable but Craig's Bond has spent his past four films brooding about his lost love, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), killed at the end of Casino Royale. This air of seriousness has carried certain risks. With his long upper lip and reluctance to crack a smile, he could have made his mark as the only grumpy Bond, but the pulsing intelligence behind the gloom has transformed it into gravitas without slowing down his performance. When Ian Fleming and John le Carre began writing in the 1950s and '60s, their books sat at spy fiction's opposite poles. Le Carre was interested in moral ambiguities while Fleming was about glamour, gadgetry and the god-like qualities of a certain breed of debonair Englishman. As Britain's geopolitical powers declined, Fleming grew a little more reflective but the Bond movies stayed on the lighter side of his imaginings. It wasn't until Craig slipped into the tuxedo and the Aston Martin that the mood changed. His Bond has been distinguished by his misgivings. And the series has adjusted its attitude to women to suit the contemporary mood. For a while, the old ruthlessness clung on. Gemma Arterton was allowed only a token appearance as one of his conquests in Quantum of Solace before coming to a sudden sticky end by being drowned in crude oil but in No Time to Die, Craig's fifth and final outing, the three women who share his adventures can look after themselves. When we pick him up at the start of this film, he's still with his new love, Lea Seydoux's Madeleine Swann. He's retired from the service and they're holidaying in a mountain town in southern Italy. It's here that Vesper Lynd is buried and he has decided to make peace with his memories by visiting her grave. But peace is hard to come by in a Bond movie and the visit turns into yet another fight for his life. Director Cary Joji Fukunaga maintains the scale and pace of the stunts, which propel the plot halfway around the world. From Italy we move to Jamaica where Bond is introduced to the new 007 - a woman. Played by Britain's Lashana Lynch, who is of Jamaican descent, she has a feisty disposition and a need to know exactly what Bond and his old friend, the CIA agent, Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) are up to. Naturally, he's not going to tell her. For one thing, he's too busy dealing with another gang of thugs who are out for his blood. He has been assigned CIA help, however. Paloma (Cuban actress Ana de Armas), his CIA colleague, is such an expert in martial arts that she dispatches several villains without losing"
162,TJH_Doc2_NoTimeToDie,TJH_Doc2_NoTimeToDie,TJH,Action,Positive,No time to die,"James Bond has saved the world two dozen times during the last half-century, but the stakes have never been higher than they are in Cary Joji Fukunaga's long-awaited (and even longer-delayed) ""No Time to Die."" This mega-blockbuster is saddled with the extraordinary pressure of salvaging the Daniel Craig era from the ruins of ""Spectre,"" justifying the spy franchise's decision to abandon standalone adventures in favor of a more serialized arc, and resolving its current run in a way that allows the 007 brand to stay relevant in the face of a Marvel-dominated future that has little room for 59-year-old sex pests on her majesty's Secret Service. Phew. While several Bonds have come and gone before, none of them have ever really needed to say goodbye - they were all effectively just replacing each other on the same deathless merry-go-round. One unflappably suave British man would get off, and another would step into the open car he left behind. These were movies without a memory, and that was a signature part of their timeless (if always trend-driven) charm. Even after 007's new wife was assassinated in the closing moments of one film, he was literally a different person by the time the next began. But the Craig-starring saga has played by its own rules from the start. ""Casino Royale"" cut Bond too deep for his scars to be Etch-a-Sketched away overnight, and so ""Quantum of Solace"" became the series' first proper sequel. ""Skyfall"" explored the past of a character who had always existed in an eternal present, while ""Spectre"" clumsily attempted to connect that present to a past the character had long outgrown (thereby inventing a template that ""Rise of the Skywalker"" would later perfect into a miserable art form). And so, in what now seems like an inevitable course-correction, ""No Time to Die"" is a story about the need to leave certain things behind. It's the modern spy movie equivalent of ""The Last Jedi,"" as the universe tells James Bond that he has no choice but to let the past die - to kill it if he has to - and dares Craig to pull the trigger. The actor barely even blinks. Instead, he limps, smirks, and shoots his way through five erratic movies' worth of pent-up emotion in order to make you cry. The result might be the least exciting Bond film of the 21st century, but it's undeniably also the most moving. At the end of the day, ""No Time to Die"" is a second chance at ending Craig's run on a strong note and tying up all of the frayed threads that ""Spectre"" left blowing in the wind, and it makes good on that potential even at the expense of several new shortcomings. Written by Bond custodians Neal Purvis and Robert Wade - with assists from Fukunaga and Phoebe ""Fleabag"" godhead Waller-Bridge - the movie is fittingly also 007's second chance at the happiness that slipped through his fingers when he took Vesper Lynd on the worst"
163,TJH_Doc3_NoTimeToDie,TJH_Doc3_NoTimeToDie,TJH,Action,Positive,No time to die,"It seems just yesterday that the world welcomed Daniel Craig to the pantheon of James Bond with trepidation and circumspection. Was he a little short and stocky to be the suave and smooth MI6 agent? Was his persona a trifle brusque and dour for the witty, charming and, might one add, superficial character we had gotten to love so much? Fifteen years and four films later, the reinvention of Bond as Craig in the origin story, Martin Campbell's Casino Royale (2006), comes a full circle in the fifth, Cary Fukunaga's No Time To Die. Fittingly, it's also the last with Craig in the lead and brings together the various aspects of his nonconformist interpretation of Bond in a most satisfying way. No Time To Die sets off with a spectacular, edge-of-the-seat opening sequence that, ironically, has nothing to do with Bond. A young girl taking care of her ailing mother is caught in a bind: while she believes her dad to be a doctor who heals, her mother tells her that he kills people for a living. On cue a masked stranger enters their home to avenge the murder of his family. A cold-blooded killing and shootout later the action shifts to the picturesque, wintry landscape outside as the girl flees onto a frozen lake and falls through the cracking ice. We cut to the present to find that she is Dr Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux), daughter of Bond's adversary Mr White, the one for whom his heart had skipped a beat in Spectre. She is in Italy with Bond following the arrest of Blofeld (Christoph Waltz), Bond's arch enemy and the head of the crime syndicate Spectre. Things appear to get serious between him and the brooding lady, but the tryst is short-lived as Spectre, with its Octopus like tentacles, comes in pursuit of Bond much as he is forced to go chasing it. Meanwhile, the troubling question looms large-did Swann betray him to Spectre-forcing him to cut ties with her and go into retirement in Jamaica. From terrorism in Casino Royale, ecology and environment and water crisis in Quantum of Solace and surveillance in Spectre, Craig's Bond has a thing for contemporary issues. Here the focus is on biological weaponry-Project Heracles which is all about nanobots spreading on touch like virus is eerily resonant in the times of the pandemic. Additionally, there is the sinister, masked terrorist from Swann's past, Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek), who is intent on using it to bring the planet to its heels, forcing Bond to come back from his sabbatical, for another big mission. Craig continues to flaunt a sexy pout and a buff body that is often wrapped up in a sharp tuxedo. Additionally, there is the grey holiday/retirement stubble. He continues to travel the world-from Italy to Jamaica to Cuba to Norway to back home in England-to be in the centre of pulse-racing action set-pieces set against majestic backdrops. There are impossible stunts, gravity-defying encounters, outrageous cat-n-mouse chases, dry wit, wry"
164,TJH_Doc4_NoTimeToDie,TJH_Doc4_NoTimeToDie,TJH,Action,Positive,No time to die,"There's the recurring line in No Time to Die - Daniel Craig's fifth and final outing as James Bond - that's heartbreakingly prescient. Now retired from the life of an MI6 superspy, Bond says he and his ladylove Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux), whom we met in the last film, Spectre, have ""All the time in the world."" All the time to heal their past wounds, all the time to write a different ending for themselves. Of course, for both the suave agent and the legions of fans who have embraced Craig's 007, that mantra is nothing more than wishful thinking. Maybe it would have been a better line for the ending of 2015's Spectre, as Bond and Swann drove off into the sunset and Craig mused in the press that he'd rather ""slash his wrists"" than return as the character. Then we all could have believed in fanciful happy endings. As it turns out, that idyllic life is just a mirage. After an opening that ties the film's main villain Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek) to Swann, the action cuts to the mountain roads of Italy as Bond and Madeleine race towards a happily-ever-after. But the tranquillity is short-lived as SPECTRE agents hunt them down. How did they find them so easily? Bond immediately thinks he's been betrayed, and after an extended chase scene, he unceremoniously chucks Madeleine on a train. No time for goodbyes. The action picks up five years later, when an old pal from earlier films, CIA handler Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), interrupts Bond's single life in Jamaica to ask him for help in tracking down a missing scientist (David Dencik) behind a dangerous nanotech, nicknamed Heracles. As the story (by director Cary Fukunaga, Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Phoebe Waller-Bridge) continues in Cuba, Bond teams up with CIA newbie Paloma (the delightful Ana de Armas) and crosses paths with his 00 replacement (Lashana Lynch). Turns out, the mission isn't a simple snatch-and-grab. Bond's been double-crossed again and before he knows it, he's back in front of his old nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz), now locked up in Belmarsh Prison. And oh look, there's Madeleine. It turns out she's the only one Blofeld will talk to. The mysterious Heracles project, which his old boss M (Ralph Fiennes) had a hand in creating, then sends Bond and Madeleine down a path where both their lives will be irrevocably changed by Safin. To say more, would venture into spoiler territory. But Fukunaga - the first American-born filmmaker to helm a Bond picture - manages to tie many plot points together, bringing Craig's run to a wholly satisfying end. Unlike Pierce Brosnan's films, these Bond stories require investment on the part of viewers. You need to know what happened in the entries before this one for the full import of the denouement to hit home. Craig's Bond is a hero that has been bruised by years of loss and betrayal, and we see the ramifications of that here. And all"
165,TJH_Doc5_NoTimeToDie,TJH_Doc5_NoTimeToDie,TJH,Action,Positive,No time to die,"James Bond (Daniel Craig, in reportedly his last appearance in the role) is retired in ""No Time to Die,"" the latest big-screen outing for Ian Fleming's spy. And director Cary Joji Fukunaga's film - at 163 minutes, it is the longest in the history of the franchise - wants it to be seen on the big screen. As for whether it is worthwhile, the long and the short of it is that this entry in the series has a series of lengthy expository scenes that set up the exciting action set pieces - just like every other Bond film. However, ""No Time to Die"" is mostly enjoyable and never dull. Call it Craig's second-best of his five Bond films, just below ""Casino Royale."" Craig is as cool as ever as Bond, and he commences with his derring-do, dispatching baddies with considerable aplomb. He is unflappable driving his souped-up Aston Martin, even when he does donuts to foil his pursuers. He can come out guns blazing to subdue those who want to kill him - although a sequence in a stairwell feels way too much like a video game. He even manages to survive a near-death experience at sea, because, well, it is No Time to Die. Alas, Bond's punny one-liners in this adventure are kind of lame. But back to the beginning. ""No Time to Die"" opens with a child-in-peril sequence. A young girl and her mother are targeted by a masked man who spares the child. Cut to Bond and Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux reprising her role from ""Spectre"") in Italy where they are having a romantic getaway. But when Bond goes to pay respects to the late Vesper Lynd, he gets wind of a double-cross and a chase sequence follows. How things end up provide the film with its pre-credit sequence. (Cue the familiar James Bond theme music and Billie Eilish's rendition of the title song.) The intrigue continues five years later when Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) contacts Bond who is enjoying his retirement to do ""one last job for old time's sake."" Felix and Logan Ash (Billy Magnussen), a U.S. State Department guy, need Bond to go to Cuba to get Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik) who has a DNA-targeted weapon that uses nanobots and relies on skin contact to kill. The Cuba sequence is arguably the film's highlight. Bond meets Nomi (Lashana Lynch), who is known as 007 now that Bond has retired - they banter in a fun game of one-upmanship - and Paloma (Ana de Armas, Craig's ""Knives Out"" costar), who has had about three weeks of training. Paloma is fantastic, kicking ass in a dress to die for no less, and de Armas plays her as nervous and naive, which is amusing. In contrast, Nomi is tough as nails and not to be messed with, even if Bond makes her work extra hard to prove herself worthy of the number. That Bond relies on both women to assist him in his various missions is"

In No Time to Die, James Bond is dead after 25 installments of the popular series about England's most glamorous secret agent-which means he will never be back-in his present form. This is also Daniel Craig's fifth and final appearance as 007, so enjoy his previously indestructible stoicism for the last time, too. Do this, I hasten to add, only if you are forever dedicated to a fictional action hero who, in your heart of hearts, can do no wrong. In my opinion, he ran out of steam long ago, and now in retirement from Her Majesty's Secret Service, he has no charm, no wit, no sex appeal, no fatal allure for women and he's losing his hair. He dies from stray bullets, deja vu, stale dialogue and mixed reviews. The car chases, the fight sequences (there are two), the helicopter shots, the never-ending guns and exploding warheads have all been done before. This is probably to be expected. You don't go to a James Bond movie to learn anything new. You go to ogle the latest girls, gadgets and exotic locations. The entertainment values are ever apparent, the violence and bloodshed have a certain lift that both defines and defies imagination, and who would have it any other way? You don't always remember what you saw the next day, but you know you had some fun. This time the excitement fades like the popcorn that went with it, and for me, ennui comes on stealthy fingers. No Time to Die may not be the worst James Bond movie ever made, but it's in heavy competition as the dullest one since Octopussy. The film's sole distinction is the fact that it's the James Bond epic that finally manages to make 007 a crashing bore. Directed with more boyish slobber than narrative coherence by Cary Joji Fukunaga from an over-crammed, self-consciously contrived script by no fewer than five writers, No Time to Die hops and stumbles all over the place, but you can still write the plot on the head of a carpet tack. It opens with a flashback to the Italian Alps where a mysterious thug in a white mask plods through the snow to murder a young Madeleine Swann's mother, but young Madeleine narrowly escapes. Cut to the character, all grown up as Lea Seydoux, who may or may not be married to a gooey-eyed, lovesick 007. (The movie is very vague about things that matter.) After some high-speed racing through the mountains in his bulletproof Aston Martin, the two lovers are set upon by agents from the evil crime syndicate SPECTRE in the town square and he dumps Madeleine, thinking she betrayed him. It's the end for Bond and Madeleine, but the movie is just beginning. It helps to know your Ian Fleming history, including Bond's relationship with Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale, as well as the meaning of SPECTRE (you got me there).

167,TJH_Doc7_NoTimeToDie,TJH_Doc7_NoTimeToDie,TJH,Action,Negative,No time to die,"Historically, the bad James Bond films have been judged so because they were just too wacky and silly. Fortunately, its utter disinterest in a hard and fast continuity meant that a deliciously hyperbolic film like A View to a Kill can erase a hackneyed Octopussy in under two years. Never before has a James Bond film been both technically well-executed and taken a more serious tack, yet still been an infuriating mess. So, congratulations, I guess, No Time to Die. Borderline impenetrable if you haven't rewatched the first four films in the Daniel Craig-era arc, this 25th canonical Bond picks up where the roundly unloved Spectre finished, with Bond in seeming retirement with Madeleine Swann (Seydoux), and a lot of baggage from earlier films that now seems borderline absurd and needlessly convoluted. The big twist in the last film was that Blofeld (Waltz) was Bond's stepbrother and the cause of all his pain, but the villain this time is Malek as Lyutsifer Safin, a waffling, mumbling pseudophilosophical maniac with the standard grand plans for global domination. Meanwhile Bond ends up more alone than ever: out of MI5, replaced as 007 by a new agent (Lynch), and terribly sad about everything. Because the newer, more emotionally rounded Bond is just sad a lot. Yet No Time to Die doesn't take the opportunity to examine Bond in a more stripped-down setting. Instead, it's the standard mix of globetrotting action, just slower and less engaging than ever before. Subplots go nowhere, new characters are dropped in with little payoff (exactly what purpose a side trip to Cuba with Ana de Armas' giddy young CIA rookie serves defies explanation), and much of the dialogue is simply meaningless - particularly every word out of Safin's mouth, which would just be nonsensical if it wasn't also delivered with all the gravitas and malice of a bus timetable. It's ponderous, tedious, and somehow both buried in continuity and determined to drop it all halfway through the story. It's not just recent Bond lore: there's a hamfisted musical sting that serves as a reference to On Her Majesty's Secret Service, further complicating the already convoluted timeline and inherently conflating two of Bond's dead exes. It's this overstuffed storytelling, mixed with lackluster pacing, that renders No Time to Die a torturous misfire, and an utterly disappointing exit for Craig's Bond. I hate to say it, but this is Bond's Rise of Skywalker. That's the saddest part of this era of 007. Craig had two of the best entries in the entire series, with Casino Royale establishing everything that was going to make him unique, and Skyfall hitting like a battering ram. His Bond was an educated assassin, charming and cold, violently loyal to Queen and Country but untrusting of both - just as Ian Fleming wrote him. Yet the last two films have written him into a melancholic corner, adding a supposed emotional depth that he simply doesn't need. Maybe the arc would have worked better across three films,"
168,TJH_Doc8_NoTimeToDie,TJH_Doc8_NoTimeToDie,TJH,Action,Negative,No time to die,"For those whose cinematic consciousness predates ""Star Wars,"" the James Bond series may be the primordial experience of franchise films, with all the pleasures and limitations that they entail. The appealing predictability of familiar characters and the excitement of seeing variations on their themes has always gone hand in hand with a sense of overmanagement-of the strings being pulled by some puppeteer far from the set. The feeling that what's onscreen is inseparable from the demands of the balance sheet has never been absent from the Bond market, and the five entries starring Daniel Craig have only intensified it. Together, the Craig films interconnect to form a sort of Bond cinematic universe whose parts slot all too neatly into a series, with all the dramatic engineering that it implies. The most recent and final Craig film, ""No Time to Die,"" directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, is in that sense a culmination of the series' necessities, with the boardroom and the writers' room virtually taking the place of any cinematic action. On the other hand, the series' essential virtue was always its extravagant exaggerations-it was gloriously ridiculous and gloriously lacking in self-awareness, its macho ribaldry invested with absurdly high purpose. In the Daniel Craig era, there's no sense of unconscious or excess expression-it has been digitized out along with any intentional humor. The devices that Bond and his compatriots use are hardly a step from Maxwell Smart's shoe phone, as are the switch-operated gizmos of his Aston Martin. Yet their depiction and use are so perfunctory that they're presented as neither silly nor ordinary, just checked off. Craig is a great actor who brings a distinctive affect to Bond-clenched, airtight, impenetrable, abraded. He makes Bond's social graces seem like the product of work that's harder than the athleticized superhero business imposed upon the character. Craig's distinctive persona suggests pathos that the series doesn't allow; instead, he's merely used as a Bond-pinata, a straining for an element of realism amid stunts that, in their grandiosity and their excess, preclude it. In ""No Time to Die,"" Bond is launched with mourning and melancholy: he and his new partner, Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux), visit the Italian town of Matera, where the tomb of Vesper Lynd (from ""Casino Royale"") is found. Bond visits her tomb-which explodes, as a prelude to a mighty chase and shoot-out. He survives but immediately ends the romance with Madeleine, whom he suspects of setting him up. Five years later, Bond, retired to Jamaica, gets a visit from an old associate, Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), of the C.I.A., along with a smarmy young State Department official named Logan Ash (Billy Magnussen). They want Bond's help in finding a scientist named Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik), who has been kidnapped from a high-security bioweapon facility with a dreadful concoction in hand: a mortal virus-like nanobot, transmitted on contact and engineered to target specific DNA markers, whether of an individual, a family, or an ethnicity.

It's a transitional movie, focused on history and legacy. As such, it pointedly references and reprises the first Craig film, 2006's ""Casino Royale."" These Craig Bond bookends work together to demonstrate that the best Bond films are not actually about Bond. As a result, it inadvertently makes a strong case for retiring 007 once and for all. ""Casino Royale"" was meant to reinvigorate the Bond franchise, and not just by casting the charismatic Craig. The film was set early in Bond's career, and it made him more vulnerable and more human, primarily by allowing another character to upstage him. Eva Green as Vesper Lynd was less like the typical Bond girl and more like the British superspy himself - effortlessly charismatic, suave, brilliant, an expert at double-cross and able to make audiences and protagonists fall for her with equal aplomb. She was Bond's match in a way villains like Dr. No or Blofeld never were. Being dazzled, out-thought and out-charmed made Bond a deeper and more intriguing character. The only problem with Vesper Lynd was that she was so riveting that they had to kill her off, lest she steal the series. Subsequent Craig films mostly presented the hero in the traditional Bond manner. He was a man without peer, and therefore also without much character or interest. ""No Time to Die"" is typical with its fill-in-the-Bond-blank plot: a ranting mad villain (Rami Malek), a global terrorist threat, car chases, gunfights, a child in danger, etc. Even with familiar characters imperiled more effectively than in earlier installments, the stakes are virtually nonexistent. And a main character who exists in a vacuum is largely airless and empty. The film's failures are all the more stark because it keeps drawing parallels with ""Casino Royale."" The opening scene is set at Lynd's grave, and the movie is filled with women who serve as stand-ins for her in one way or another. A Cuban CIA agent, Paloma (Ana de Armas), wears a plunging dress reminiscent of Green's signature look and picks out a tuxedo for Bond, just as Lynd did before her. Lashana Lynch plays Nomi, the woman who (temporarily) takes over the 007 designation from Bond after he retires, just as Lynd in some ways replaced Bond in his own film. But the most obvious stand-in for Lynd is the romantic lead, Madeleine (Lea Seydoux). Madeleine urges Bond to forget the deceased Lynd and takes her place as the love of Bond's life and as his (maybe) betrayer. She's got a complicated backstory of her own and an intense history with Bond, and on top of all that, she's a brilliant psychotherapist. What she doesn't have is Green's insinuating flare or enough narrative space to actually balance or challenge Bond for narrative importance. And having so many would-be Lynds means they all start to seem like interchangeable afterthoughts. They don't humanize Bond by cutting him down to size (""I sized"
170,TJH_Doc10_NoTimeToDie,TJH_Doc10_NoTimeToDie,TJH,Action,Negative,No time to die,"There are now 25 official movies produced by EON featuring James Bond in all his resplendent MI6 British glory. The first group of Bond movies, those with Sean Connery as 007, were fun, fast-paced, and from a visual point-of-view, sunny travelogues with interesting, often exotic, locales. ""Dr. No"" began the era in 1962, and ""Goldfinger,"" a great spy adventure, is the high point. Roger Moore's long string of Bond films are usually too goofily over-the-top. Pierce Brosnan's 007 entries were epic, big budget Nineties blockbusters that clicked with audiences. ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" George Lazenby's single stab at the genre is harmless filler, although elements of it play fast and loose with some facts known from the earlier films based on Ian Fleming's novels. Timothy Dalton's two Bond pictures - ""The Living Daylights"" and ""License To Kill"" are vastly underrated and deserve another chance from those of you who've rejected them. Daniel Craig's 007 arrived with a burst of glory in 2006 with ""Casino Royale."" This was a serious reboot for the series and fans loved Craig and his Bond. Alas, the excruciatingly bad ""Quantum Of Solace"" follow-up almost derailed the admiration. Craig and 007 recovered nicely with ""Skyfall,"" which holds the title of most financially successful Bond movie of all time. It's very nearly perfect. A villainous Blofeld returned in ""Spectre,"" which brought the franchise an even moodier 007. Two interlopers, those non-EON efforts sniffed at with an air of disregard by purists, are the 1983 return of Sean Connery as Bond in ""Never Say Never Again,"" after he had previously quit the series, as well as a different ""Casino Royale,"" an earlier silly spoof from 1967. Now we have ""No Time To Die"" and Craig's dark and dour MI6 agent has amplified his discontent. It's also the actor's last outing as 007. If what we see on-screen is a possible blueprint for future Craig entries, thank goodness this is good-bye. Who should replace Craig? Either Richard Madden of ""Game Of Thrones"" and television's ""Bodyguard,"" or Henry Golding of ""Crazy Rich Asians"" and ""Monsoon"" are my choices. There something timely in ""No Time To Die."" The traditional, and rather shopworn, Bondian weapon of mass destruction - yes, another one - is a lethal viral contagion that will be delivered by nanobots, all concocted by a scientist who won't shut up. This twisted assault on humanity is due to the fact that the villain, a lizard-skinned bore named Lyutsifer Sifen - a play on ""Lucifer Satan,"" get it - has psychological issues because of how his parents died. He also loathes Spectre, which is both odd and interesting. Rami Malek is Sifen, and he's woefully miscast and deadly dull in the role. A boring villain is not what we want. Everyone knows the better the villain, the better the movie. The first five minutes of ""No Time To Die"" resemble a horror movie. The next ten minutes are a romantic idyll. Then for about twenty minutes we have a"
171,BJY_Doc1_Taken,BJY_Doc1_Taken,BJY,Action,Positive,Taken,"Since the entire plot of this film is given away in the masterfully delivered trailer, it's not divulging anything to say that Taken is a modern-day revenge thriller. This presents an interesting experiment, actually. Considering that there aren't really any surprises to be found in Taken, beyond those we were offered in the pre-release snippet, are splendidly realized action sequences enough to carry this film? The answer here is a resounding ""yes"". Taken may be a simple film, but it's not simplistic, and even though the first third of it is spent recapping what we knew going in, the second and third acts here deliver enough thrills and action to make this film riveting, even if we know exactly where it's going. By setting the chase within the ultra-sleazy world of human trafficking, which we secretly hope is just a media creation, but know deep inside that this reprehensible and inhumane phenomenon is a reality, the film is propelled by a sense of urgency that isn't present in most revenge films. Liam Neeson's daughter isn't ""Dead"", she's ""Taken"", so his race against the ticking stopwatch tracking her probable fate provides enough tension to diffuse any disappointment in knowing exactly what's going to happen here. The selling point here is how deftly Liam Neeson hacks his way through a bevy of Albanian baddies. Neeson is untested as an action star, but watching him maneuver his way through the sea of detritus here, we're left hoping that he's got a franchise in him. The film may not have the intricacies of the expertly crafted Bourne films (although, like every action film made since Bourne appeared on the screen, the fight scenes here owe an obviously rich debt to Matt Damon's antics), but the gritty and realistic path Neeson carves to get to his stolen daughter is sufficient to deliver the promise implied by the fantastic trailer. You don't have to be a parent to understand and sympathize with Liam's plight here, and there is a morbid but exhilarating sense of release in seeing the evil empire pay for its transgressions. Sometimes morally complex, ambiguous studies of man's desire for revenge are too preachy to be entertaining. Taken doesn't really care if you like Liam Neeson or wonder if he's doing the right thing by flagrantly taking the law into his own hands; the film just wants you to strap yourself in and enjoy the tidings as he hands out beat-downs all over Paris. This film doesn't want you to think. Like Neeson's character quickly realizes, thinking is often not a luxury present in dire circumstances like these. Action is what counts, and for those who miss the era of the lean, mean 85-minute skull-crack fest, Taken will re-conjure the giddy thrills of watching Dudikoff, Seagal, and Van-Damme chomp through a slew of B-Movie terrorists. Having an Oscar-caliber actor delivering the judo chops only sweetens the pot. Forget about Oscars, plot points, or coherence. This dude's daughter has been kidnapped, and he's a"
172,BJY_Doc2_Taken,BJY_Doc2_Taken,BJY,Action,Positive,Taken,"It's been a long time since I watched an action movie and was so involved, riveted to the screen, and rooted so much for the main character as when I saw last weekend the thriller Taken (2008) written by Luc Besson and directed by Pierre Morel. The film has not been released in the USA yet even though it's been out for months in Europe and Asia. I don't understand why because as the action movies go, this is very entertaining and dynamic picture. The plot involves the kidnapping of an American girl (Maggie Grace) vacationing with a friend in Paris, by the gang of Albanian human traffickers specializing in selling young women into forced prostitution. Her estranged father Bryan (Liam Neeson), a retired CIA agent, the member of the elite ""Special Activities Division"" Black operations is on the phone with his daughter at the very moment of kidnapping and he's got just a few days to find out who is behind the crime and to try to get his daughter back before it is too late. If you've seen the trailer for the movie, the Neeson's close up and his short but convincing speech addressed to the invisible unknown man who is listening to his daughter's cell phone, would tell you everything you have to know: ""I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."" The film follows this statement closely, and makes it a really fast running 93 minutes. The plot is anything but new - back in 1985 Arnold Schwarzenegger as retired elite commando had only a few hours to find and rescue his daughter from an exiled dictator. The first and by far the best season of hit TV series 24 had Kiefer Sutherland as LA based CTU Agent Jack Bauer chasing of all sorts of terrorists who taken his teenage daughter. In its bets moments, Taken brings as much excitement and adrenalin as these classics. Another thought came to my mind while watching the movie, if ever Liam Neeson was considered for the part of Bond, James Bond? If not 007 himself, he could have easily been s Bond's older brother, less glamorous but as dangerous and deadly. Taken touches on horrific but sadly existing and blooming business of international women trafficking, the slave trade of our times. Do not expect the movie make some serious social comments or provide the deep insight into the dirtiest business possible. Neeson's hero is not out to save"
173,BJY_Doc3_Taken,BJY_Doc3_Taken,BJY,Action,Positive,Taken,"Having hardly seen his wife (now ex) and daughter for the last decade or so due to his work, Bryan is now a former special agent who has taken his retirement early in order to move close to where his estranged family now live. Despite his better judgement, he gives consent for his 17 year-old daughter to go to Paris with a friend. However all his ""paranoia"" is justified when his daughter calls him during an abduction by some unknown men. Using his contacts, Bryan learns of an Albanian group specialising in kidnapping travelling young women into sex slavery and estimates he has 96 hours maximum before she is drugged beyond redemption and sold into prostitution. Calling on a lifetime of skills, Bryan goes to Paris to track down those responsible and find his daughter. I have not heard or read any reviews for this film when I went to see it but I imagine that many of them will have called this film a cross between Death Wish and the Bourne films because that is what it happens to play like. The Death Wise side of it makes it a little harder to enjoy but the Bourne side makes it worth seeing. The thin plot is where we have the Death Wise material as the nice retired man who loves his daughter turns out to have been correct that the world is a hideous place outside of the US whenever his daughter gets kidnapped. With hours before she is transformed into a junkie and working for her hits, Joe goes to a Paris where it appears that the Louvre is the only building NOT fully of young women trafficked into sex (and we never seen that so I have no proof). Fortunately, rash violence will save the day. OK so politically this is not the most pleasant pieces of work to be watching but, aside from the first twenty minutes of setup (some of which I could have done without) the plot doesn't really matter and it becomes a race against time thriller. This is where it does owe a great debt to Bourne because the filming style, the action, the urgency and the fighting style are all very similar to the formulae used to good effect in that trilogy. The camera never sits still, the editing is fast and the sound-effects produce an audience reaction themselves. Of course it is very much derivative of Bourne and not up to that high standard but it does still make for an engagingly violent thriller. When it stops moving even for a second, it sags and it doesn't seem to know how to link the scenes (so many actions scenes fade to black and then into a slower scene setting up the next sequence) but mostly it keeps the pace high and keeps moving. This does not make it a great film though, and it is quite a cynical affair in some regards however it is hard to fault it when"
174,BJY_Doc4_Taken,BJY_Doc4_Taken,BJY,Action,Positive,Taken,"According to movies, Paris is not safe anymore on the first day you get there! First, kidnappers took Harrison Ford's wife in ""Frantic""; now they took Liam Neeson's daughter and her friend in the action thriller film ""Taken"", where both girls will be sold as prostitutes by Albanians slave traders. But instead of a vulnerable doctor like the one presented in Polanski's film, our hero is a former CIA agent with skillful tactics that goes to rescue his daughter from the evil. Among the favorable points of this film, besides a great performance by Neeson, is the way this father manages to save his daughter and the techniques he uses to track her last steps after being kidnapped. Small things that makes a total difference like hearing the traders conversations on the phone or even asking his daughter before she was taken to mention a few characteristics of these people (but this moment fails a little if one considers the impossibility of someone doing so since she was very distressed, and how come these guys show up without wearing masks which would make impossible their recognition?). Of course, some of these things are pure exaggeration but as long as the film played with some tension, nice action sequences and a solid drama involving human trafficking and all the desperation of the main character, we are thrilled with a above the average flick. A few things could be worked better or played more fairly and that is 1) the editing, because we need to know who is beating who. The fights are great, Neeson is very believable in doing all this and writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen provided to the main character lots of combat with Nagasu Do, a interesting and mixed martial art style, but the director, editor and the camera went all nuts and they wouldn't allow us to see precisely what was going on in key moments; 2) the cold-blooded character played by Neeson and his coldness didn't work at some moments, most notably where he shoots at a woman trying to discover where one of the traders were. This was something surprisingly strange to see it, didn't work so good, and this kind of implacability works better in a Bond film or a Schwarzenegger type of film (and ""Taken"" resembles ""Commando"" a little bit). It is comprehensible in the context used for this film, here's a desperate father trying to save his daughter in a short period of time, he did way worst to the guys who took her but for some reason this was too strange, and this woman wasn't even involved in the whole situation although her husband was. It might be an overdone and cliched picture but it has a lot of good things to show, it's well made, well acted with a nice supporting cast with names like Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen, Leland Orser, Jon Gries and Xander Berkeley, and the action is great."
175,BJY_Doc5_Taken,BJY_Doc5_Taken,BJY,Action,Positive,Taken,"In a world of James Bonds, Jason Bournes, and Frank Martins, it's hard for a little random ex-spy named Brian Mills to get some love. On the surface, his film seems a little formulaic, and he seems a little...well...old. However, once we get into Mills's story, and see how infinitely badass the wonderful Liam Neeson plays him, you'll probably be saying something along the lines of ""James who?"". 'Taken', which follows Mills as he pursues those responsible for kidnapping his daughter, is a heart pounding thriller with a stupendous display of badassery from Liam Neeson. It may have a plot that's sort of unbelievable, but it's one of the best action thrillers in years. Why do critics dislike this movie? Is it because they have no ability to see beyond the obviously far-fetched events of the movie? Is it because they take themselves too seriously and don't know how to have fun? It's probably both of those two reasons, but I find peace in thinking that they're complete idiots who don't know what they're talking about...sometimes. The fact remains that 'Taken' is plain fun, popcorn entertainment, that doesn't resort to cheap explosions in looking for thrills. It relies on the gritty closeups of the marvelous hand to hand combat and stylistic action (Liam Neeson's 'Batman Begins' training certainly paid off here). The film is the brainchild of Luc Besson, the mind behind the Transporter films. Here, he relies on a director that may be inexperienced as a director, but one who also has more experience in shooting action on film than most. Pierre Morel, responsible for the photography in action films such as 'War', 'Unleashed', and of course, 'The Transporter', does a great job in choreographing some very good action sequences, especially giving them some flavor when they end. The film was not just pure action, which was good, as it also showed Neeson's character working as a spy and shows some intelligence in that aspect. Speaking of Neeson, it appears that his days as the kind hearted mentor figure in films such as 'Narnia' and 'Star Wars' are behind him. His ruthless, badass, and perfectly natural performance makes the movie watchable and carries it from start to finish (which isn't too long, as the film clocks in at one hour and 45 minutes including previews). Neeson is a veteran, and it really shows. His performance goes deep, and will excite the viewer in all ways. Maggie Grace was also noteworthy as his daughter (it was tough to recognize her without her blonde hair!). This is probably the best example I've seen in a while of how stupid and self-righteous most film critics can be. They fault 'Taken' for having events occur that aren't entirely realistic. Do they recognize the film for being a great roller coaster ride that will leave most viewers happy (pretty much my entire theater of 150 people seemed happy)? No. It's further proof that Liam Neeson is one of the best leading men around, and"
176,BJY_Doc6_Taken,BJY_Doc6_Taken,BJY,Action,Negative,Taken,"From beginning to end, this film packs an amazing adrenaline rush - that much is certain. Perhaps it is the straightforward, nearly nonstop Liam Neeson-as-Steven Seagal action that is buoying the movie's reputation as it enters the rental phase of its life, or the legitimately serious topic of child exploitation / the worldwide child/young adult sex trade, but despite these strengths, the film also causes me to pause and consider its even more distressing qualities - plot holes and inconsistencies, ethnic stereotypes, and the exchanging of one inexcusable violence for another. Plot Holes: Almost too numerous to mention. Take your pick. Why break into a 5th floor apartment in the middle of the day, carrying two young girls out kicking and screaming when you can pick them up for a ""party"" later, isolate them somewhere in the city, and then kidnap them? How does a man with an Irish/American brogue pass as a French police officer without speaking a word of French? Why does Neeson say he ""was a traitor, not a villain"" (or whatever he says on the rooftop) - was there any other explanation of this? I can do willing suspension of disbelief. Really. I know that it's meant to be mindless entertainment... but Rambo Does Paris? It's too much to be a film of any serious importance. Ethnic Stereotypes: This was particularly bad - spoiled, ignorant Americans safe in their virginal land of California until they discover the dangers that lurk across the ocean in a ""foreign"" land... the French cutting deals with crudely stereotyped Albanians and Muslims (the ""Paris always surrenders"" myth) while the righteous Americans have to step in and kick tail... and on down the line. Worse still was the death of the traveling companion (because she has sex with boys) and the salvation of the daughter (spared long enough to be saved because she was pure and thus more valuable) - while this may be a dirty truth of the human slave trade, it still sends an unmistakably puritanical message to audiences. Violence: Violence against women - especially sexual violence - is abhorrent. That being said, vigilantism, torture, and murder are no panacea for what ails human society. If everyone pulled a Liam Neeson, there would be anarchy. A 7 or 8 out of 10 means that you want people to take a film seriously. This film, while interesting in some respects, adrenaline-pumping and exciting throughout, merits no more than a 5 or a 6 for those qualities. It is meant to be eye candy and a good mindless summer rental. It is NOT a serious film that will have a lasting impact upon cinema. Perhaps the most disturbing thing to me as a member of the critically thinking (?) public is that lately we have been eating these sorts of movies up like it's our job - and then assigning critical kudos where none are deserved. Whether it's ""Wanted"" or ""Taken"", we are mistaking mindless action (which has its place at times)"

Apparently, we're supposed to derive some kind of psychological gratification from the Freudian symbols of innocence, fatherly love, superhuman strength and righteousness. It actually reminds me of the fantasies I had when I was 8. Here's the plot: a rich, spoiled American virgin girl goes to Paris with a friend and gets abducted by Albanians and sold into sex slavery. Luckily, her daddy happens to be a ex-CIA agent and tracks them down effortlessly, kills and tortures them in a blood-curdling fashion and gets to his daughter just before she gets her throat slit by the evil (yet also stupid looking so you can still feel good about yourself), toad-like sheik. On his way, daddy makes a such a spectacle of killing and torturing people that it makes you wonder whether anyone would take so much trouble if no third party was watching. He doesn't even spare people who are innocent and are unlucky enough to get in his way. Like the wife of a French agent involved in the mess, whom Neeson shoots in the arm, because her husband refuses to give him information on St-Claire. (Meanwhile, their kids have been tucked into bed 5 minutes ago yet they don't seem to wake up. Yep, totally.) All the circumstances are miraculously in Neeson's favor. His daughter is talking to him on the phone when she gets abducted. (otherwise, how would he know? Most victims of sex slavery are poor East European girls who don't have cell-phones, which would be too boring). Also, she's standing in the bathroom from where she can see her friend being abducted first, so daddy has enough time to instruct her how to hide and to shout out the details of their complexion while being dragged away (at which she miraculously succeeds, despite her panic and the struggle she puts up). Also, multiple men can apparently easily get into a hotel room and abduct two girls, but Neeson has to use Spiderman skills to get inside. Well, thank God the bas relief of the wall was adjusted to his height exactly; otherwise, the movie would have ended there. Another point that disturbed me very much is Neeson indifference to the scores of other girls who have been drugged and raped by Albanians. Apparently, the PRINCIPLE of sex slavery doesn't concern him, just the fact that it happens to HIS daughter. In the end, Neeson returns with his daughter to America, with only a broken arm after fighting hundreds of heavily-armed men. Also, he has no trouble leaving France after killing each and every one of them. (France must be a Third World country). Everyone is happy and his ex-wife has to admit he's not such a loser after all. Every Freudian fascination has been satisfied trice over. This movie does absolutely no justice to Eastern Europeans (all Albanians are shown as stupid scum and we're supposed to gloat seeing"

An 8.0 rating on IMDb means it's equal to movies like 'The Matrix' or 'Die Hard'. Admittedly I'm quite a big action fan , and I do understand the concept of it not being 'realistic'. That's what films are. They're stories. Name me one movie that is completely realistic with no fantasy elements included and I'll give you a million bucks. However when I saw this movie I was bored , embarrassed during some scenes at how atrocious it was , and I found it to be completely overrated. The action was slow , the cinematography was laughable , the acting from everyone except Neeson was very sub-par and I just felt disappointed. This isn't the action movie that would start a second renaissance , of course not. That's not what I was expecting. I didn't think it'd be anything more than a tour-de-force action film that was pure entertainment and silliness wrapped into a satisfying bubble. And honestly all I got was another second-rate action movie that's not even worth the time and effort to watch unless you're an extreme fan of the genre. I mean , during the scene where Neeson runs to the boat to get his daughter... the camera cuts so many times and there's about a million shots of his car in different angles that I completely forgot what was going on. That's just an example of the many things I thought brought the movie down. I really don't see how this film deserves the recognition it has received. I've read the forums and people say ""well it's an action flick... you're not supposed to take it seriously!"" To that I say , why isn't Meet the Spartans in the IMDb 250? ""Well , it's a parody flick , you're not supposed to take it seriously""? The same principal applies. I'm not trying to say the film isn't enjoyable because that's down to tastes. I'm just saying firstly; film technicalities ( i.e. the direction , photography , musical score ) were atrocious and anyone with a basic knowledge of film and its production will recognize this. Secondly; the acting of the support cast quite bad. Not Troll 2 bad , but still not something you'd expect to see in a Liam Neeson movie. More like something you'd see in one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies from the 80's. Thirdly; the directing was very amateurish. I felt this constant need to find Pierre Morel and hit him every time the scenes went on too long. He'd be extremely bruised right now. I really wonder how the screenplay went for this movie , too. I'm guessing the writers/artists got very proud of their ability to draw and started getting excited during the car scenes , resulting in about 200 frames"

Kim gets the chance to go to stay in Paris for a few weeks with a friend, but needs parental permission before leaving. Bryan reluctantly signs off, but under many strict conditions, including calling him when they arrive. He finally gets a hold of her, only to listen to her being kidnapped. He vows to find her, and use all of his ""skills"" to do it. It may not sound like much, but the trailer for Taken looked interesting, and sounded even better. But after seeing this all occur in the first twenty minutes, it leaves a lot to be desired for the next hour. The film, action movie or not, has virtually zero character development. In my brief description, I basically give away everything you learn about Bryan and Kim. Sure, there is a throwaway bit about Kim's intentions in Europe (which are completely unrealistic in 2009), and vague proddings at what Bryan used to do. We obviously have an idea of the type of work he was in from the way he moves, and these skills he speaks of early on, but never anything that really furthers our knowledge of him. It works in the way of him being a bit of an enigma to the audience, and really surprising everyone with what he can do, but it makes the film that much less believable. The story itself, looks like it was just culled together from half-hearted movies previous, and any form of surreal, overly choreographed action genre picture from the last ten years. No The Matrix does not take a ripping here, but anything featuring Jet Li, Jason Statham and the like does. Hell, I have not even seen Banlieue 13 (or District 13 as we better know it in North America), and I know this movie is stealing from it. Taken even throws in some torture scenes just to leave no post-9/11 stone untouched. Have action films gotten so stale that you can easily tell which pieces of other films got thrown into a blender to create this one? Is it really that hard to create something as unique or at least vaguely different like Wanted, Iron Man, or even The Dark Knight? Even No Country for Old Men has more interesting action scenes. It just feels like we have seen it all before, but the film tries to make it feel more original by throwing Neeson, an actor who has done such varied work in his career, into the mix. The editing, in a sense, makes and breaks the film. On one hand, the film is never boring. It moves at such a rapid rate that you may find standing up to leave even faster than you sat down.

I even offered to see if we could get our money back. My only hope was that the girl get kidnapped soon so that we could get to some more exciting parts of the movie. Thank goodness the kidnapping scene was minutes away, and I admit that scene got my heart pumping. If only the rest of the movie were that good. Lest we leave any cliches unturned, we now return to Liam. His dialog indicates he's flat broke, but his daughter's step-dad is rich and can send Liam to Paris on a private jet. Naturally mom and step-dad stay behind, because that's what most parents would do when their daughter is kidnapped overseas into the female slave trade. After his arrival in Paris, Liam hooks up"

He is hired by a man however to do the opposite, the impossible. To infiltrate a tycoon's subconscious and plant an idea instead of take one - known as inception. This movie shattered my comprehension and mind a million times over, and the more I try and work it out, the crazier it gets. How on earth does Chris Nolans brain work? How to you conceive this script from nothing? A story so intricate, intellectual, complex and layered that simply watching it is mind-bending, let alone writing it. The thought of sitting down and working through the labyrinth-like story and characters is incredible daunting. Every single facet of this film can be taken down a seemingly endless rabbit hole. Ive said this before, but now, truly, I can say: I have never seen anything like this. Nolan has pushed the boundaries of storytelling and how it doesn't necessarily have to be transparent for an audience to grasp onto it. There is a plethora of things I couldn't comprehend while watching - but it honestly never took away from the film in general. It was never too convoluted that I became overwhelmed and uninterested. Was I completely mind-broken, scratching my head the entire time, yes. But I still was able to focus on the plot point at hand and be insanely immersed. It struck an incredible balance of being complex, but still allowing the viewer to be immersed in the moment and not in thought. You don't have to understand the science and logic of it to have the watch of your life - vaguely understanding the labyrinth of layers and depth is kind of what makes it incredible. I can understand the scope and scale of what Nolan is doing, but I'm not going to sit down and map it all out. What a premise for a film, and what a delivery. Amid the spiderweb of subconscious and dreams within dreams, there is a character I grabbed onto and empathized with. Cobb is a broken widower, and it was fantastic learning about his trauma and wife piece by piece. We're guessing throughout at the entire picture of his past, but it is slowly, sometimes painfully unveiled to us with brilliant pacing. I was right there in those moments with Cobb as he opens up to Ariadne, or confronts his wife in the void. And the end, oh my god the end. He finally confronts his wife and the guilt he bears, giving us, the viewer, the final pieces of their story puzzle - catharsis man, catharsis. An incredible character and a heartbreaking story with high stakes attached, threatening to derail their mission. I really like what Cobbs story and the movie as a whole says in terms of our subconscious and trauma. Cobb suppressed his emotions and guilt for so long they threatened to consume him. Any mission he went"

But while it's really good this film isn't perfect their are some flaws but the flaws can be overlooked like for example their is a lot of exposition in the film but it's necessary since it their to explain the concept of the movie since it involves Dreams which is a weird concept that any normal person would be asking questions about like how do they work?, can this happen?, what happens if I do this?, etc. The film is super entertaining their is not a time you will feel bored or feeling like your time is being wasted like the dreams they never get through what's the point of it existing but instead it always begins right in the middle of it. Like in the beginning of the movie we don't have scene of Cobb & Arthur arriving at the party, talk with the other guests, planning a meeting with Saito which finally establishes why we are here. It skips all that & instead has us learning that Saito is in a dream & that he has a secret that's worth stealing right away before we learn all the other info first since we don't start off in the beginning of the dream we start off in the middle of it which has us constantly wondering what happened before this? how did they get into this situation? whenever they enter a dream which gives it one of the most thrilling movie openings of all time & leave anyone watching with excitement on what's going to happen for the rest of the movie. In the first dream our characters kidnap Fisher which has them having to deal with his security, in the second dream they are already trying to get Fisher to join the team all while the environment of the dream is being moved around with due to gravity of the car chase, In the third dream we are scouting out a military base which has Fishers secret the team has been looking for. Notice how their is no filler here it's all just what we want to see it's made to make sure we don't get bored. But this does sorta make Fisher seem like a boring character that is just a tool for the characters goals but that's where your wrong since they have Earmes infiltrate his legal team but they skip all the boring interview steps & instead put us right in the moment we want to see he we see the relationship Fisher & his father have right away these scenes are also connected with a clear reason & motivation for us being here so it doesn't feel random or out of nowhere. The concept of Dreams in this film is also very interesting they aren't bound by any rules or realism through out the film characters are hopping between dreams all the time that differ from"
183,GLZ_Doc3_Inception,GLZ_Doc3_Inception,GLZ,Action,Positive,Inception,"Leonardo DiCaprio and friends are ninjas of the subconscious, dashing through the landscape of other people's dreams, in Christopher Nolan's Inception. This endlessly fascinating swirl of a film could have come only from Nolan, who blends the cerebral twistiness of Memento (his thriller that moves backward in time) with the spectacular action of his Batman megahit, The Dark Knight. DiCaprio, as a thief-for-hire named Cobb, doesn't merely skulk around sleeping minds, pilfering strangers' secret thoughts. He and his team, complete with architect, actually construct the dream worlds they'll enter, with streets that can rise up and become walls-the city as Murphy bed-or, if things go wrong, a train roaring through city traffic. You may get a headache keeping up with the plot as Cobb tries to plant a new idea in a man's brain; stealing thoughts is simple, but adding one is a risky operation involving a dream within a dream within a dream. Even as you tick off the film's overload of references, though-a Matrix here, a James Bond there-the amazing effects and Cobb's quest carry you along. But Nolan is the brainiest of Hollywood directors, and Inception is more than the ultimate ""it was all a dream"" movie. It is the most sophisticated in a year of splashy screen events about parallel worlds, in which characters enter alternate realities and return with some solution to personal and often global problems. Cobb's dangerous assignment is meant to save the world from an energy conglomerate. Avatar's hero goes to Pandora, falls for its nature-loving people, and learns to value the environment. The characters on Lost travel sideways to other times and places in what seems an attempt to escape the island, but turns out to be a way to save their own souls. Even Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland transforms Lewis Carroll's story into a journey of self-discovery fit for the 21st century. The movie's Alice is a 19-year-old who returns from Wonderland realizing she doesn't have to marry the smug gentleman her family selected; she can head out to sea and open a trade route to China instead. These films, not radical-minded indies but among the most expensive and popular onscreen, suggest that reality is so fraught and problematic that we need to go elsewhere-out of this world or deep into our minds-to see things clearly. They evoke a Wizard of Oz parallel dimension (""You're not in Kansas anymore, you're on Pandora,"" the villainous colonel in Avatar warns), but their lessons are more political than ""There's no place like home."" Cobb is hired by a businessman (Ken Watanabe) to plant a thought in the brain of a rival (Cillian Murphy). The new idea: the rival must break up the conglomerate he is about to inherit, which is poised to control half the world's energy and become, as one character puts it, ""a new superpower."" A too-powerful energy company? Nolan's astute and prescient observation seems like eyes-open common sense in these BP-weary days. As his plot mirrors world events, Nolan"
184,GLZ_Doc4_Inception,GLZ_Doc4_Inception,GLZ,Action,Positive,Inception,"""I hate my dreams. They're so ... infantile."" Heaven knows what artist Laurie Anderson would make of Christopher Nolan's first film since ""The Dark Knight,"" but if audiences don't go for it, we're more likely to hear a different complaint: It's just too darned complex. A spectacular fantasy thriller based on Nolan's own original screenplay, ""Inception"" is the smartest CGI head-trip since ""The Matrix."" The premise is so out-there, it requires not just a leap of faith but also too much screen time to explain, so do yourself a favor and pay attention. Leonardo DiCaprio is Cobb, an ""excavator,"" who digs around in people's subconscious while they're catching some zzzzs. This act of infiltration is ""not strictly legal""; the motive is not therapeutic but espionage and theft. It's also not a solo operation. To do the job properly requires an ""architect,"" basically someone to design an appropriate dreamscape, something vivid and detailed enough to keep the dreamer's defenses down. Depending on the complexity of the project, it might also require a ""burglar,"" a ""chemist"" and preferably someone on the outside to administer a well-timed wake up call. Cobb's partners include Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); a newbie, Ariadne (Ellen Page); Yusuf (Dileep Rao); and Eames (Tom Hardy). Their client, Saito (Ken Watanabe), wants more than access to a rival industrialist's grey matter; he requires Cobb to plant an idea in there that will dismantle an entire conglomerate. As if that weren't hard enough, Cobb is also plagued with keeping his own demons at bay, in the form of an angry dead wife (Marion Cotillard). DiCaprio evidently hasn't got ""Shutter Island"" out of his system yet. A kind of meta-heist movie, ""Inception"" evokes Philip K. Dick's cerebral sci-fi, the exploration of alternate states of consciousness, memory and fantasy. But these are also Nolan's themes, familiar from the amnesiac noir of ""Memento"" and the many, varied mind-games practiced by the warring magicians in ""The Prestige"" as well as the psychological warfare between Batman and his adversaries (fans of that series will recognize several familiar faces popping up here). ""An idea is like a virus,"" says Cobb, and that idea too might have been born in Gotham City or in the rabid enthusiasm that greeted ""The Dark Knight."" Like ""Memento"" and ""The Prestige,"" ""Inception"" is constructed as a box of tricks. Ariadne (who helped Theseus slay the minotaur in Greek mythology) devises labyrinths that are also escape hatches, and that metaphor of the maze runs through ""Inception,"" which is itself a puzzle to be navigated by filmmaker and audience alike. In the course of probing his subject's subconscious, Cobb escorts him into a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream. If it's a little disappointing that each level plays out as a straight-up action thriller (this guy really should get out more), the rules of this game are delightfully devious. He has a tendency to over-complicate, but nobody bends time more ingeniously than Nolan. Three minutes in one dream might correspond to an hour in the next, and both transpire in"
185,GLZ_Doc5_Inception,GLZ_Doc5_Inception,GLZ,Action,Positive,Inception,"Writer-director Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" is about an espionage expert, Leonardo DiCaprio's Dom Cobb, who has a highly specialized way of stealing corporate secrets: He extracts them from within the dreams of his targets. Depending on your taste for narrative logic, Nolan's penchant for delineating dream states carries either a built-in advantage or a huge liability. If you don't mind being tossed about in a state of high confusion for 2-1/2 hours, as dreams enfold within dreams and subconscious states are poised in an infinite limbo, then this is your dream movie. I found myself more inclined to sympathize with Cobb's notion that, in limbo states, hours can turn into years. After one too many dreams-within-dreams-within-dreams, I was feeling in limbo myself. Which is not to say that ""Inception"" isn't a compelling thrill ride. It's just not much of a fun ride. Nolan, best known for his ""Batman"" movies and the time-shifty ""Memento,"" is very big on noir. For him, black is beautiful - i.e., horrible. When Cobb starts hunting dream worlds, he never encounters anything transcendent inside anybody's noggin. The darkness of this movie, as was also the case with Nolan's ""Dark Knight,"" is magisterially oppressive. Cobb's situation, despite its newfangled presentation, is fairly conventional, even sappy. Once upon a time he became a fugitive from America for supposedly causing the death of his wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard, who, coming after Michael Mann's ""Public Enemies,"" is Hollywood's designated noir vamp). Mal keeps invading his dreams, or the dreams he concocts within other's dreams-within-dreams, or their dreams within his dreams, or - oh, forget it. Anyway, she's up to no good, even though, technically, she's dead, or in limbo, or something. The point is, man-with-a-past Cobb is still in love with her. She is, literally, the woman of his dreams. His enraptured state is scaled big, Wagnerian big, but neither he nor Mal can quite fill out the ardor. That's because Nolan, ultimately, is a head guy and not a heart guy. He's all about architecture. Everything in this movie issues from the heavy doominess of its look. Things lighten up ever so slightly when Cobb, hired by a Japanese tycoon (Ken Watanabe) to do some heavy-duty extraction - excuse me, inception - on a corporate heir (Cillian Murphy), assembles his A-Team of fellow dream foragers, including Ellen Page's Ariadne, master forger Eames (Tom Hardy) and sidekick-researcher Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). But even here, Cobb too often spoils the party by offering up such deep-think pronouncements as ""we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential."" I cite this line, which is typical - not to mention unoriginal and probably untrue - because many people are going to be conned into thinking ""Inception"" is some sort of high-I.Q. whirligig just because it's festooned with Mobius strips and M.C. Escher stairs and everybody in it seems to understand what's going on even if you don't. (The biggest, the only, laugh line at my screening came at a particularly confusing time when Ariadne"
186,GLZ_Doc6_Inception,GLZ_Doc6_Inception,GLZ,Action,Negative,Inception,"Director Christopher Nolan is such a master movie technician -- a combination of engineer, architect, game designer and God -- that it's startling to realize how constricted his vision is and how clumsily he tells stories. ""Inception,"" Nolan's first film since his mega-googolplex hit with ""The Dark Knight,"" and his first as a solo writer-director since the now-legendary puzzler ""Memento"" in 2000, is supposed to be a dreamscape movie. At one point, in fact, we travel with its central Scooby-gang of characters into a dream within a dream within a dream, and then into some deeper, still more unconscious, psychological limbo-state below that. Managing all these nested levels of narrative is a marvelously nerdy accomplishment, no doubt -- but this is the most tight-assed vision of the innermost human psyche I've ever seen. While Nolan's images are visually impressive and powered by state-of-the-art digital effects and accomplished stunt work, they're always ordered and organized with anal precision. They don't look or feel anything like dreams. (Or, at least, not like my dreams.) They look instead like mediocre action films from the '90s, or in the case of the supremely boring ski-patrol vs. Arctic fortress shootout found on Level Three, like the Alistair MacLean adaptation ""Ice Station Zebra"" from 1968. (With Rock Hudson! And Ernest Borgnine!) ""Inception"" may have been directed by Christopher Nolan, but Nolan's dreams are apparently directed by Michael Bay. OK, I know -- you want me to back off the high-minded analysis and tell you whether ""Inception"" is a good destination for those summer moviegoing dollars eager to leap out of your wallet. Sure, I guess so. It's a cool-looking action movie, carefully constructed and edited, that uses all kinds of nifty locations and a lot of portentous-sounding expositional yammering. It inhabits a Philip K. Dick-style universe of psychological warfare that suggests ""The Matrix,"" ""Total Recall"" and ""Minority Report"" -- all of them, by the way, better movies -- but it's fairer to call ""Inception"" a maze movie or a labyrinth movie than a puzzle movie. Because, as the wisecracking fellow critic sitting next to me observed, every time the story gets puzzling the characters call a timeout and explain it. So, yeah, if you approach ""Inception"" with lowered expectations it's a pretty good time. Problem is, there are no lowered expectations around Christopher Nolan, whose adherents have proclaimed him as the heir to Kubrick and Hitchcock and declared ""Inception"" a masterpiece. I don't want to get sidetracked here, but let me suggest that the comparisons aren't entirely misguided. They're just not helpful. Nolan has inherited some of Kubrick and Hitchcock's worst tendencies, most notably their defensive, compulsive inclination to work everything out about their stories and characters to the last detail, as if human beings and the world were algebraic or geometrical phenomena requiring a solution. But the mysterious power of Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" cannot be explained by the ludicrous official story revealed in the final act -- indeed, it nearly scotches the whole movie -- and"
187,GLZ_Doc7_Inception,GLZ_Doc7_Inception,GLZ,Action,Negative,Inception,"Christopher Nolan's Inception is Instruction Manual Cinema, a film that spends so much time explaining-and explaining, and explaining-the rules of its narrative conceit that it fails to either emotionally engage or, except in a few notable spots, viscerally thrill. Working from a canvas at once larger than The Dark Knight and yet markedly reminiscent of it (not to mention countless other celluloid sagas), Nolan's would-be epic is a work of sometimes stunning imagery but only affected heart, a pseudo-heist film that borrows liberally from all corners of the cinematic world (The Matrix, eXistenZ, Last Year at Marienbad, the canons of David Lynch and Michael Mann) in service of a tale that's as hollow as its reality-bending Rubik's Cube ruses are intricate.Focusing on a secret agent man named Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), who enters people's dreams to steal vital pieces of well-kept information, Nolan's sci-fi latest is enraptured by the sense of falling down the rabbit hole, not simply via its dreams-within-dreams-within-dreams centerpieces, but through the sheer wealth of information it vomits up at every turn. Head-spinning exposition takes the place of wonder throughout, leaving only the transient rush of particularly vivid visuals and a faint whiff of a better film that could have been.Nolan wastes no time with setup, immediately thrusting viewers into a perplexing scene in which Cobb washes up on a sunny shore, sees a vision of two young children playing in a grassy yard, and then visits an elderly Japanese man whom he seems to know. This encounter takes place in a gorgeously decorated chamber with wall panels and hanging lamps, but lingering to admire the sights isn't Inception's strong suit, and soon the film is off into other apparent realities, with chitchat filling in the gaps at breakneck speed. Turns out, Cobb is trying to pilfer valuable knowledge from corporate bigwig Saito (Ken Watanabe) as a test to see if he's up for a larger task-one that involves not taking info from someone's mind (a process called ""extraction""), but rather, inserting a new idea (dubbed ""inception"") in the noggin of energy magnate Maurice Fischer's (Pete Postlethwaite) only heir, Robert (Cillian Murphy). For mysterious reasons related to his dead wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a penchant for showing up unannounced in dreams and thwarting Cobb's robberies, Cobb isn't instantly interested in this dangerous, difficult gig. Nonetheless, Saito's promise that performing the job will mean Cobb can finally return home to the U.S.-where his kids are, and from which he's been exiled for enigmatic legal reasons-quickly seals the deal.From there, we're treated to a lengthy middle section in which Cobb assembles his team and concocts his ruse, a standard heist-film structure that quickly proves most notable for the myriad rules governing dream infiltration, and for the wholesale lack of importance of said regulations. Phony tech, philosophical, and psychological terminology abounds but it's all of little concern except as a means of generating confusion, which in turn distracts attention from the inconsequentiality of the heist itself.

Slap! Wake up, people! Shalalala! Slap!Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb (the name sounds like it should evoke something-but what? Dummkopf?), who specializes in plunging into people's ""subconscious"" minds while they sleep and extracting their corporate secrets. (I'm with Freud in preferring ""unconscious."") But his new client, Saito (Ken Watanabe), wants the impossible: for Cobb not to steal an idea but to plant one in a business rival's head.Why is an ""inception"" more difficult than an extraction? ""The subject's mind always knows the genesis of an idea,"" explains one character-which strikes my unoriginal and highly suggestible mind as dead wrong. But that's the premise, anyway. Cobb accepts the job because he longs to see his two little kids in the U.S. and is forbidden to return on account of a Crime to Be Revealed Later; and Saito says that with one phone call he can make the legal problems go away. (He just can.) Then Saito says what in this kind of thriller are magic words: ""Assemble your team.""A team of colorful specialists! Cool! So it's, like, Mission: Impossible in the Dreamscape-Matrix! Cobb's point man is Arthur, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who also evokes The Matrix: He looks like Keanu Reeves's runty little brother. Eames (Tom Hardy) is the ""forger,"" who can impersonate people in dreams without those dumb M:I rubber masks. The chemist, Yusuf (Dileep Rao), will create the badass sedatives that will hold the fragile three-dream edifice together. The brilliant architecture student Ariadne (Ellen Page) has two functions: dreamworld designer and exposition magnet. She's a newbie, so Cobb has to explain to her how the science works. It takes a lot of explaining.Nolan, who wrote the script, thinks like a mechanical engineer, and even when you can't follow what's happening, you can admire in theory the multiple, synchronized narrative arcs and cute little rules for jumping around among different flights of consciousness. He has two fresh ideas. In a dream, you can fall asleep and have another dream, in which you can fall asleep and have another dream-except time works differently at different depths. A minute up top might be, say, ten minutes in the dream, an hour in the dream within a dream, and, below that, years. Although the different levels look the same (too bad), the gimmick allows Nolan to have three clocks ticking down instead of one, and the editor, Lee Smith, has cut among them in ways so ostentatious that he's all but sewn up this year's editing Oscar.The other neat touch is the Freudian monster femme who keeps popping up: Cobb's wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who emerges from his own unconscious (even in other people's dreams) to sabotage his schemes.

189,GLZ_Doc9_Inception,GLZ_Doc9_Inception,GLZ,Action,Negative,Inception,"At the movies, incomprehensible gibberish has become a way of life, but it usually takes time before it's clear that a movie really stinks. Inception, Christopher Nolan's latest assault on rational coherence, wastes no time. It cuts straight to the chase that leads to the junkpile without passing go, although before it drags its sorry butt to a merciful finale, you'll be desperately in need of a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card. Writer-director Nolan is an elegant Hollywood hack from London whose movies are a colossal waste of time, money and I.Q. points. ""Elegant"" because his work always has a crisp use of color, shading and shadows, and ""hack"" because he always takes an expensive germ of an idea, reduces it to a series of cheap gimmicks and shreds it through a Cuisinart until it looks and sounds like every other incoherent empty B-movie made by people who haven't got a clue about plot, character development or narrative trajectory. Like other Christopher Nolan head scratchers-the brainless Memento, the perilously inert Insomnia, the contrived illusionist thriller The Prestige, the idiotic Batman Begins and the mechanical, maniacally baffling and laughably overrated The Dark Knight-this latest deadly exercise in smart-aleck filmmaking without purpose from Mr. Nolan's scrambled eggs for brains makes no sense whatsoever. Is it clear that I have consistently hated his movies without exception, and I have yet to see one of them that makes one lick of sense. It's difficult to believe he didn't also write, direct and produce the unthinkable Synecdoche, New York. But as usual, like bottom feeder Charlie Kaufman, Mr. Nolan's reputation as an arrogant maverick draws a first-rate cast of players, none of whom have an inkling of what they're doing or what this movie is about in the first place, and all of whom have been seen to better advantage elsewhere. Especially Leonardo DiCaprio, who remains one of the screen's most gullible talents. After his recent debacle in Shutter Island, Martin Scorsese's dopey insane-asylum bomb, one hoped for something more substantial from the easily misled Leo, not another deranged turkey like Inception. He should have stayed in bed. I'd like to tell you just how bad Inception really is, but since it is barely even remotely lucid, no sane description is possible. Let's see. It opens with crashing waves on a beach. In the middle of a July heat wave, I wanted to jump in, but the thrill didn't last. Cut to the battered face of Leo, looking like a 14-year-old washed ashore facedown from a toy sailboat. He has come from another location conjured up in a dream, and is fond of muttering jabberwocky like ""I am the most skilled extractor of dreams."" In other words, he can close his eyes, enter somebody else's dreams with his pock-marked baby face and blow up China.

Nolan's follow-up offers more muted colors, gift-wrapped themes, and GQ leading men with stockbroker comb-backs over the frowns carved in their brows-indicators of high-minded artistry, all. Leo DiCaprio has every reason to scowl, shackled with a character named ""Dom Cobb."" Fugitive Cobb is a corporate espionage hired-gun expert at ""extraction"": lifting secrets out of targets' minds. Drugging them, then joining them for naptime, Cobb can drop in to guest-star in their dreams, and there pick the locks of his marks' subconscious-often represented as an actual safebox, as everything in dreamlife is signified by genre-movie totems. Cobb is planning his ""last job before he retires,"" a mind-cracking with the untested mission of leaving an idea in his mark's head. The target is the heir to a corporate dynasty, Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy), who must be persuaded to abdicate his waiting throne. This will be achieved through running amok in his subconscious and prying in the desired suggestion, using Junior's daddy issues as a lever. (Do not linger long over the ethics of mental rape; Nolan doesn't.) Following caper procedure, Cobb assembles a team: his researcher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), mimic (Tom Hardy), apothecary (Dileep Rao), and a novice recruit, Ariadne (Ellen Page), the architect who'll landscape the dreamworlds that they'll hunt. Tagging along on her debriefing, we get glimpses of Cobb's history, his unresolved anguish over the mysterious end of his marriage, from which spring his personal demons that inconveniently invade other people's dreams in the vengeful form of former wife ""Mal"" (Marion Cotillard). Cobb also lays down the rules of shared dreaming to us via Ariadne, explaining that ""we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential""-a shopworn line that appears almost verbatim in this week's The Sorcerer's Apprentice, though it's a sure bet that only one of those movies will be buried in laurels. As Ariadne learns the ropes, we get teasing flexes of the f-x budget, M.C. Escher stairs and Parisian streets folding over themselves like a crepe. The Hans Zimmer score suggests we shouldn't be gassed on these images so much as, I dunno, respectful? The introductions to placeholder characters, the taking notes through the tutorial scenes, it's all let's-put-on-a-show buildup to opening night, the heist, the stage for a moviemaker to show his stuff. Cobb slips Fischer Jr. his mickey on a Sydney-to-L.A. flight-it's like an Olivier Assayas business-class thriller, with context scrupulously removed. Nolan has blueprinted a palatial set piece inside Fischer's sleeping mind, an involuted whorl of dream-stages leading to deeper dream-stages. Team members break off in rear-guards, defending one level so the rest can continue on in dreams-within-dreams. Nolan cross-cuts between each stage as synchronized alarm clocks tick toward zero, while surface actions send rippling reactions along the chain. Three set pieces in one! This Neapolitan ice-cream approach is ambitious-and pretty routine when taken"

All of those elements make The Toxic Avenger not only one of my favorite movies but also one of the all time great Cult Classics and Troma Entertainment at their best. Set in the fictional town of Tromaville, New Jersey,The Toxic Avenger tells the story Melvin Junko(Mark Torgi),a 90-pound weakling that works as a Janitor at the Tromaville Gym and is always getting pushed around. When Melvin becomes the victim of a terrible prank,Melvin jumps out of a window into a barrel of Toxic waste turning Melvin into the most hideously deformed creature of Superhuman size and strength that protects the people becoming...The Toxic Avenger(Mitchell Cohen). Before The Toxic Avenger, Troma Studios was(and still is)an independent studio company that produced low budget Sex Comedies such as Squeeze Play(1979),Waitress(1981),Stuck On You(1982)and The First Turn On!(1983)to little success. Then along came The Toxic Avenger, an amazing and over the top Horror Comedy Action Superhero film that became a Cult Classic that put Troma entertainment on the map and also spawning three sequels, a children's Cartoon series, a stage musical and gave movie audiences one of the most beloved Superheroes of all time in The Toxic Avenger. In other words, Troma was the studio The Toxic Avenger built. The Toxic Avenger is a classic Horror Comedy, a great film and one of the goriest, bloodiest and most politically incorrect films of all time and is so depraved and twisted that I don't a major studio then and now would have made The Toxic Avenger the way it is. Only s company like Troma entertainment would have the guts to make film this way. The Comedy in The Toxic Avenger is hilarious, wild and over the top thanks to the characters and situations that happen in the movie and you as a viewer will be in tears laughing while at the same time being disgusted at some of the things you see which I think adds to the appeal and so bad it's good style of The Toxic Avenger. What also makes TTA so funny and over the top is the way the film tackles subjects in a offbeat style such as violence, sex, corrupt politicians, Gym Clubs, toxic waste dumping, criminals, drug use and more. No subject in this film is left untouched. While TTA is a Horror film the Horror doesn't come from the movie being scary because it's not, the Horror comes from the amounts of violence and gore that happens in the film. The blood and gore while not very serious and at times funny the gore is not for the weak at heart because the blood and gore comes fast and quick. For a movie that was made on a small budget,TTA has some really great and exciting Action and fight scenes that are thrilling and"

A trio of films appeared on USA which caught my attention, the Toxic Avenger series, and I was introduced to Troma. This was their flagship series, and it was rare that you'd find any other item as entertainingly zany, sick, and cheap as these films. Even close to these films were the Class of Nuke 'Em High movies which dealt with high school kids introduced to what toxic waste could do. But, in The Toxic Avenger, a geeky, buck-teethed janitor whose trusty mop was always by his side, ogling the bikini-clad aerobics gals who'd come to the gym he was employed to maintain their impressive bods, is the subject of what toxic waste can do to your anatomy when the skin and body are immersed in such chemicals..it can turn you into a grotesque superhero with amazing physique and martial arts skills, not to mention you can rip arms off and propel men in the air with ease. It all starts when four psychopaths, Slug(Robert Prichard), maniac Bozo(Gary Schneider), and their girlfriends, Wanda(Jennifer Prichard) and Julie(Cindy Manion)who frequent a gym wish to cause ""mop boy"" Melvin Junko(Mark Torgle)as much harm and humiliation as possible just for the hell of it. During their past time, these four enjoy driving over innocent people with Bozo's car, adding up points kind of like in the movie Death Race 2000. We see this when the four single out a kind little kid with a helmet riding his bike as they run him over before crushing his head under their back tire! They take Polaroids, for which gets the girls hot and bothered. Yep, this is not for the squeamish or those who demand films of good taste. Anyway, Julie prompts Melvin to slip on a pink tutu so that she can get all worked up for a little sex, setting the poor kid up for a cruel practical joke, concerning a lamb, with all the customers of the gym laughing their asses off at his expense. Tormented and crazed, Melvin throws himself through a window. What Melvin doesn't expect is to fall into a barrel of toxic waste placed inside a parked truck hauling the stuff to a nearby landfill. The toxic waste in turn transforms Melvin into a ghastly monster with a homing beacon towards evil. Anyone corrupt, gangsters, hoodlums, and crooked city officials, are targets of the Toxic Avenger. Three slimy thieves with weapons attempting to rob a taco store with an innocent bi-stander getting a shot-gun blast to the chest, a blind beauty's seeing-eye-dog also getting it right in the stomach, with our toxic superhero coming to save the day. He rips the leader's arm off before stuffing him into a stove, makes an ice-cream sundae out of another's face before driving a drill into his eye, and boiling"
193,SRG_Doc3_TheToxicAvenger,SRG_Doc3_TheToxicAvenger,SRG,Horror,Positive,The Toxic Avenger,"1984's ""The Toxic Avenger"" is the movie that put Troma Entertainment on the map. Previously employed as a distribution machine for titillation comedies, Troma hit pay dirt when they switched their focus to silly splatter efforts and horror pictures, finding a rabid audience who couldn't get enough of their specialized brand of winky mayhem. ""The Toxic Avenger"" is the prototype for subsequent Troma endeavors, mixing a bewildering cocktail of one-liners and ultraviolence in a production that actually desires to make audiences laugh, even while it kills a kid and a dog, and points a shotgun at a baby. Still, the earnestness of the feature is amazing, always working to find a note of absurdity to molest as directors Michael Herz and Lloyd Kaufman (billed here as ""Samuel Weil"") bathe the screen in blood, nudity, and slapstick, funneled into a superhero spoof with a vague environmental message. 30 years after its initial release and ""The Toxic Avenger"" still manages to trigger disgust and a handful of laughs, representing not only a key Troma financial victory, but it's quite possibly their finest original work. Melvin (Mark Torgl) is a hopeless weakling working as a janitor at the Tromaville Health Club, where he mops floors and is subjected to constant bullying from its customers, including Bozo (Gary Schneider) and Slug (Robert Prichard), and their girlfriends, Julie (Cindy Manion) and Wanda (Jennifer Babtist). When a prank goes horribly wrong, Melvin jumps into a barrel of toxic waste, with the resulting mutation turning him into a powerful monster with strong moral values. Out to help the fine folks in Tromaville, the Toxic Avenger (Mitch Cohen) is transformed into a hero, a development that irritates Mayor Belgoody (Pat Ryan Jr.), whose corrupt ways are threatened by this new arrival. As Toxie takes a blind girlfriend in Sara (Andree Maranda), the melted savior is marked for death by Mayor Belgoody, threatening the future safety of the beleaguered community. ""The Toxic Avenger"" has a weird joyfulness that's infectious, even while it stages ghastly deaths and dismemberments. Kaufman and Herz construct a rather effective silent comedy in the midst of all the brutality, with the picture playing just as effectively with the sound shut off. With a cast that wildly gesticulates with every line reading, broad physical comedy, and a hulking, deformed hero, it's fairly easy to follow the feature without hearing it, as it periodically reaches Vaudeville-style shenanigans. It's not a tasteful endeavor (maybe babies should be spared the magic of moviemaking), but it has a defined spirit that carries the adventure from beginning to end, stopping occasionally to assess character motivations and explore the romance between Toxie and Sara. Horrible, and I mean horrible stuff happens in ""The Toxic Avenger,"" but rarely does the effort sit around and wallow in ugliness, always on to the next bit of awful it can manipulate into horror and comedy. Herz and Kaufman serve up quite a buffet of incidents in the feature, challenging screenwriter Joe Ritter to piece together a"
194,SRG_Doc4_TheToxicAvenger,SRG_Doc4_TheToxicAvenger,SRG,Horror,Positive,The Toxic Avenger,"1 you must like spoof & parody movies. There are endless details making this movie great. Its texture is not much different from A class/budget spoofs like police academy, naked gun, hot shots etc. This movie is an endless parody of movie cliches. Some people mistake targeted parody for poor acting. No way. I'm not saying it's an A+ Hollywood rubbish colossal, yet during the first part of the movie ( the mop man weakling made fun of ), you clearly see facial expression, mimicks etc are over the top & purposefully so. This movie has scenes that are copied, borrowed or else identical in super budget A+ later movies. Ex when the mop man bathes into toxic waste: Joker from Batman movies, anybody? Ex when the monster hijacks a car with two villains, killing one and riding the other at full speed to his death: the crow, anyone? And when the car finally explodes & the monster is unarmed: Terminator anyone? The blind girl ( Maranda is very very pretty ) affair reminds of Ben the rock man from the fantastic 4 in some comics. The scene where the slutty bimbo teases the mopman to wear a ridiculous outfit to arouse her, only to trick him in front of a sheep with bra in front of everybody, so he runs away in shame with all the overly exaggerated gestures is a clear parody of many culprit ""trauma scenes"" from more famous movies. The moral is all those glossy & fancy morons poking fun at the nerdy mopman are in reality drug addicts, weirdos, killers, hit&run drivers, pimps, pushers etc; so in reality the ""pathetic"" mopman & the ugly monster are much better than those scumbags. There is gore but not much & anyways not enough to bother an adult. There are a few girls who'd belong to a porn flick, a sauna masturbation scene & the monster has sex too, but overall it isn't more graphic than most cable TV crime movie; i'd say less. There is violence bar none: two weirdos cane an old lady to death; a dog is shot & the blind bimbo is almost raped (clockwork orange spoof ). There is also parody of more conventional items in superhero movies. Ex Batman hides in the bat caves; Superman in the north pole Fortress and the monster hides in a junkyard. When he gets the blues for being sick of mashing criminals, he & his girlfriend go hide in his favourite place: another dump. There you get a camping tent & she's in bikini. The monster roars & that's clearly an incredible Hulk spoof. To rescue hostages in a fast food, the monster faces criminals who are themselves a parody of the bad bunch: an horny Negro, a painted-face punk white and a third slick dressed white who faces the monster with some agility martial arts moves, etc. Again, parody of a bunch of cliches. The monster helps oldies cross the street; helps housewives open cookie"
195,SRG_Doc5_TheToxicAvenger,SRG_Doc5_TheToxicAvenger,SRG,Horror,Positive,The Toxic Avenger,"This film believe or not is one of my favorite films of all time, it's also kinda another one of my childhood gems, well more like my teen gems, I'll explain. It kinda was a gradual build for me, I first discovered this franchise from the cartoon show ""Toxic Crusaders"" which I thought was cool and I didn't even know at the time this was loosely inspired/based on the movie ""The Toxic Avenger"". I didn't see this film until I lot latter when I was a teenager about 16 and I'll admit it blew me away it wasn't entirely what I was expecting but that what made it all the better as it was outrageously fun and funny; watching it now as an adult is even more fun and funner than before. It's also one of the films that actually inspired me, yes I'm not kidding in writing and getting into the entertainment business. This film to me really turned things on their head let alone turned up the notch on violence, effects, comedy, and the superhero genre up to 11. The content and wild expressionism in this film wasn't common place at the time, it was defiantly before some of the TV shows ""South Park"", ""The Simpsons"" which are just as nuts, and that's part of what made the film great for me because it wasn't afraid of being what it wanted fun while doing what it wanted. This film was made on a low budget but I felt it was money well spent just showing that you can still make a good fun film despite limitations; as opposed to most big budget film where some tend to disappoint because they forgot one crucial element fun. The music is great it's one of my favorite movie soundtracks I really like the song ""Body Talk"" which is a catchy tune and a fun one to use if you ever want to do aerobics or fitness training. This film of course we're in it for the action and comedy and like any well done floor it shines on both. The comedy is great the whole thing plays out like a live action Mad Magazine cartoon, it's rich in both verbal and visual humor. I also feel has a bit of replay value because sometimes watching this again I can pick up on more jokes that might have flied over me. The characters are fun, everyone in Tromaville are kinda live action Mad Magazine characters because not everyone is totally normal there is always something unusual about them or are just crazy. From villain despite unlikeable which is the point their still funny, like Cigarface as well as the two health club bullies Slug and Bozo whom are all true to their names, let alone the fact Bozo has got some real impulse problems as he gets easily stressed and angry over the smallest or stupidest thing, it cracks me up whenever he blows up. And Toxic/Melvin whom is a solid superhero."

So many points for someone on a bike, so many points for an elderly person, and big points for a small child. ""How many points for a child on a bike?"" asks the driver, excited. Learning this will earn him maximum points, he proceeds to knock the small child off his bike, and he goes flying over the hood. They turn round and see the child move in pain. Horrified that he may lose out on his points, the driver then proceeds to reverse over the child's head, squashing it completely. Two girls get out of the car and take some pictures. This scene, for me, represents the majority of this film. More shocking than it should be, even today, but never taking itself at all too seriously, regardless of the horror on show. Melvin (Mark Torgl) is a skinny, nerdy loser who works in the swimming baths, forever cleaning up with his mop. He is frequently bullied and humiliated by a high school gang who one day play a trick on him, which sees him kissing a goat dressed in a tutu. Horrified, Melvin flees and throws himself through a window, landing on a conveniently positioned (and open-topped) barrel of toxic waste. He begins to burn and rot, and eventually the toxic waste causes him to mutate in a taller, stronger, and ultimately more heroic beast, who wants revenge on his tormentors. Toxie (as he is now called, played by man-mountain Mitch Cohen) starts to clean up the city of Tromaville, which is being run by corrupt mayor Peter Belgoody (Pay Ryan), while at the same time romancing blind girl Sara (Andree Maranda) who he rescues from a rapist in a restaurant. This was Troma's first big hit, and also their first foray into horror, having previously focusing on really crap sex comedies. After this, which after an initial unsuccessful run became a popular cult favourite on the B-movie circuit, they focuses only on horrors. This is the second Troma film I've seen. The other was Killer Nerd. You can probably assume from the title that it is a god-awful excuse for a film, although it is quite amusing in it's filmed-on-video awfulness (starring Harvey Pekar associate Toby Radloff). This, I'm pleased to say, was actually good! It was a hell of a lot more violent than I was expecting, and the special effects are actually pretty impressive in some places. And Toxie proves to be a likable vigilante/superhero, however hideous he may be. Having said that, this is a low-budget Troma, and it's not exactly Citizen Kane. The acting is wooden, and the film is so 80's you can practically reach out and feel the sweatbands and mullets. But it is funny, satisfyingly gory, and, most importantly, fun. Toxie proves to be a more interesting 'superhero' than the majority of others. And the"

A narration informs us that 'New York City, the worlds capital of culture & industry. Here, among the towering skyscraper's, civilization is guided by men of progress & the wonders of technology. But for all this industrial advancement there is a price to pay. Pollution, the unavoidable byproduct of todays society, every year millions of gallons of poisonous wastes, garbage & radioactive chemicals are disposed of in nearby towns such as Tromaville the toxic waste dumping capital of the world. Our story takes place at the Tromaville health club where a young man named Melvin Furd (forget what the IMDb says, it's definitely Furd not Junko) works. Melvin's entire life, in fact entire being was changed by toxic chemical waste...' Melvin (Mark Torgl) is a real loser, nerd & all round wimp. Melvin is a mop boy at the the Tromaville health club & everyone makes fun of him, especially four local thugs named Bozo (Gary Schneider) his girlfriend Julie (Cindy Manion) plus Slug (Robert Prichard) & his girlfriend Wanda (Jennifer Prichard as Jennifer Babtist). One day the four decide to play a cruel practical joke on Melvin & humiliate him in front of as many people as possible. However things go wrong, or right depending on whichever way you look at it I suppose, & Melvin ends up head first in a barrel of hazardous toxic waste. As a consequence Melvin mutates into the Toxic Avenger (Mitch Cohen as Mitchell Cohen), wow. After saving an Irish cop named Officer O'Clancy (Dick Martinsen) from a gang of three thugs, Cigarface (Dan Snow), Knuckles (Doug Isbecque) & Nipples (Charles Lee Jr.) Toxie discovers that he enjoyed being a hero & so decides to clean Tromaville up by single-handedly wiping out the evil forces which contaminate the town. Mayor Belgoody (Pat Ryan as Pat Ryan Jr.) is as bent as they come & starts to notice a drop in his profit margins from his illegal activity, he puts pressure on the Chief of police (David N. Weiss as David Weiss) to find the Toxic Avenger & kill him before Toxie finds & kills them... Directed by Micheal Herz & Lloyd Kaufman as Samuel Weil I thought The Toxic Avenger was one seriously brain-dead film made for idiots by idiots, you can take that anyway you like considering that I actually quite liked it. The script by Joe Ritter is as stupid as you can imagine, this thing makes the Police Academy films (1984 - 94) look like the pinnacle of sophistication! The jokes are really dumb & moronic, furthermore it stretches the boundaries of acceptability & taste. The Toxic Avenger pokes fun at blind people, beating old ladies up, running children over & going back to crush their heads while later on in the film a woman masturbates over some photographs of the incident & putting a dwarf into a washing machine & turning it on.

198,SRG_Doc8_TheToxicAvenger,SRG_Doc8_TheToxicAvenger,SRG,Horror,Negative,The Toxic Avenger,"In the world of movies, many know of the main genres that cover all kinds of stories. But like anything else, there's always sub levels to these groups which can be broken down even further into their own genres. These genres are not the ones people either readily know about, have access to or is spoken of. An example of this are films produced from ""The Asylum"". Their reputation has become known for either making cheap knock offs or making cheap sequels to popular mainstream blockbusters. There are people who actively invest their time into those films. The same could be said for films made by Lloyd Kaufman under the Troma Entertainment banner. In a way, it's just another acquired taste like the previous company mentioned earlier. And although Kaufman was directing films a decade or so before this movie, it was this that got people's attention. The story written by Kaufman and Joe Ritter in his first credit is about the fictional town of tromaville located on the outskirts of New York. The town is filled with polar opposite citizens; those who have common sense and others who literally do the most absurd things no reasonably sane person would ever do. Among them all is Melvin Junko (Mark Torgl), a loser pool boy at the local health club. He's by no means socially equipped to navigate through such an environment and is easily bullied. One day after a group psychotic adults play a practical joke exposing him to toxic waste, he transforms into The Toxic Avenger (Mitch Cohen) and voiced by Kenneth Kessler. Now having superhero strength, Melvin takes it upon himself to rid the evil in his town of Tromaville. The film was also directed by Kaufman and Michael Herz, who collaborated with Kaufman on a few previous projects. What works in the movie's favor is the tone audiences will experience from the execution. It's a simple plot about a discarded protagonist whose misfortune seen to others, turns out to be the best thing that could have happened to him. While out on his crusade Melvin crosses paths with a blind girl named Sara (Andree Maranda) and soon develops a connection. It's cliche but seeing the protagonist earn the respect from someone is something anyone would want. Does that mean the acting and characters well rounded? Absolutely not. Except for Melvin and Sara, no other character has redeeming qualities or resembles that of any regular human being. The way the actors play them and the way they're written are bizarre caricatures of what someone having no idea how a real person would behave. It's very strange to watch but that's partially the appeal because it is so out there. Of the adults that badger Melvin, Julie (Cindy Manion) and Wanda (Jennifer Babtist) are the women of the group who have the most reprehensible interests. Topping it off though are their partners beating up grannies in the street who are rightfully named Slug (Robert Prichard) and Bozo (Gary Schneider)."
199,SRG_Doc9_TheToxicAvenger,SRG_Doc9_TheToxicAvenger,SRG,Horror,Negative,The Toxic Avenger,"I can say the most positive thing about The Toxic Avenger is that it knew what it was. Sure, it's a horrible, horrible, incredibly bad film, but at least unlike other top worst movies of all time, this one knew it was meant for B-Movie status. Or at least for some midnight views or drinking games. For someone who has not seen a singe ""Troma"" film ever, until last night, I was pretty shocked on the lengths these directors and writers went. From the extreme homophobia, to vehicular manslaughter while drinking and driving and actually shoving a shot gun into a toddler's face. I'm guessing this (1986) was far before the PC-movement or they simply wanted you to turn your brain off. Sure, you would have to turn off your senses while watching, but as much fun as some of the movie was, it was hard to ignore the blatant disregard for taste/humanity. Yeah, I mentioned some of the movie was fun. It was, only because it was so over-the-top in its bathroom humor and bad special effects/voice-overs. (Man, that Toxic voice-over was hilarious, though I never knew if it was one of the jokes.) I didn't, however, mention the deliberate misuse of transporting toxic waste because it was an obvious set-up and part of the overall camp of the movie. Nerdy, nerd, nerd Melvin's the janitor in charge of the mop at a gym and is getting picked on. Why? Because he's misunderstood? No, because he's such an exaggeratedly bad form of geek that makes Napoleon Dynamite look like the captain of the football team. And he should honestly never be let out of his house for his own safety. At any rate, he sort of works by mopping and goggling the bimbos until a plan is hatched to rid the gym of this eye sore by humiliation that turns into him leaping out of a window into, you guessed it, toxic waste. From there, this Frankenstein's Monster with a brand new voice and body seeks out justice for whatever reason you can think of. But, this is not a Batman vigilante. This one not only has no conscious of murder, he slaughters. I could say this is where the movie gets silly, but that was from frame one. No, this is where is where the movie gets sick and turns more horror. Sure, there are more comedic, intentional or not, moments, but they layered on the gore and violence and some of the oddest characters lifted right from Garbage Pail Kids cards, and no, I'm not talking about mutated characters. These were the humans. I honestly can't recommend this movie to anyone other than the midnight-movie, drinking (or other forms of controlled substance) or lovers of bad movie groups. I will say though this movie is obviously set up as a comedic fun-ride and not to be taken seriously for a second, the underling messages of homophobia and violence against kids still is very disturbing."
200,SRG_Doc10_TheToxicAvenger,SRG_Doc10_TheToxicAvenger,SRG,Horror,Negative,The Toxic Avenger,"I've never seen a Troma film before but I do remember watching the ""Toxic Crusaders"" cartoon as a child with a vague awareness that it was based on a movie. Something recently brought that cartoon to my attention again for the first time in decades and so I figured I'd dive into the movies from which the character originated. So, with no context whatsoever and only a passing familiarity with the sort of movies that built Troma's cult following, I ordered all four Toxic Avenger movies from Amazon. So it begins. THE TOXIC AVENGER isa movie. That much is true. It's not a great movie and I'm certain I could find countless people who might even call it total garbage, but I don't hate it. It's unapologetic, violent, crude, stupid, and filled to the brim with the most hateful of characters but I can still see some of the charm shining through. I have no qualms with bad movies. Movies can have shoddy production values, incomprehensible writing, and wooden acting but still find redemption in the spirit. THE TOXIC AVENGER has spirit to spare. It's a low, low budget horror/action/comedy from people who love making movies and have a certain creative spark when it comes to special effects. Let's face it, this movie hasn't got the depth of a $10 plastic kiddie pool but it accomplishes what it set out to do: to titillate, offend, gross you out and, most importantly, make you laugh. In this sense, TOXIC AVENGER succeeds. As the movie opens, we're introduced to Tromaville. It's a cesspool of toxic waste dumping, political corruption, rampaging criminals, and a health club where everyone is just the worst. Melvin Junko (Mark Torgl) is the focus of everyone's hatred. The poor dork with the unfortunate face and dim wit is a mop boy under constant assault from the likes of Bozo (Gary Schneider) and Slug (Robert Prichard, who really looks like a ""That 70's Show"" era Ashton Kutcher). These aren't your average workout thugs either; when they're not torturing Melvin or sexing up their buxom girlfriends, they're out running down pedestrians in their car and racking up points in their sick games. One afternoon, the punks formulate a plan to prank Melvin and it results in Melvin (in a pink tutu) going headfirst into a barrel of toxic waste. That toxic waste mutates Melvin into a scarred, hulking monster (Mitch Cohen) with a sixth sense for detecting evil. And when he detects evil, he has to clean it up. Because he's got a mop. Get it? So now Melvin, as this toxic monster, makes it his mission to violently murder Tromaville's criminals and get a little revenge in the process. He also finds love in the arms of the beautiful blind Sarah (Andree Maranda), whom he saves from certain death in a fast food robbery. And that's about it. Melvin transforms and we get a series of graphically violent murder scenes for about forty five minutes before the movie decides"
201,MLS_Doc1_ItChapterTwo,MLS_Doc1_ItChapterTwo,MLS,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two,"When It was released in 2017, it quickly established itself as one of my favorite films of the year. Despite having a (completely normal) fear of clowns and a general hatred of horror films that feature children, I loved the R-rated/supernatural horror meets The Goonies vibes It had. Since then, I've been equal parts looking forward to and dreading seeing the sequel. It Chapter Two picks up 27 years after its predecessor and introduces us to the grown-up version of the Losers Club. Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) is the only member of the group that has stayed in Derry. His self-appointed mission is to keep an eye on things and call his friends home when he is certain Pennywise has returned. The Losers reunite and join forces to try and defeat Pennywise for good. I am still torn whether or not I enjoyed this movie. I think it's a worthy conclusion to the first film, but it disturbed me more than any horror movie has in a long time. It wasn't your average scary movie filled with jump scares and gore. It Chapter Two had a masterful balance of building tension, making you dread what was coming, then hitting hard with a jump scare or extended terrifying scene. It left images in my head that lingered hours after watching the film. (I can never eat another fortune cookie) Once scene in particular that stuck with me was the funhouse mirror maze sequence. It's partially featured in a few of the trailers, I don't want to give anything away, but it's intense. The film also starts with a brutal controversial scene that is causing a lot of debate. Again, I won't spoil it, but it's the second chapter of the book, and its purpose is to demonstrate how the entire town of Derry is affected by Pennywise's presence. The locals are unnaturally indifferent to racism, homophobia, missing children, etc. Which leads to one of my biggest complaints about the films. Without multiple viewings or reading the book, it's easy to miss this affliction on the town of Derry and I consider it to be an important element to Pennywise's character and the development of the members of the Losers Club. Another common negative I'm hearing about the film is its runtime. It's just under three hours long, but I didn't feel the film dragged or felt long at all until the final showdown with Pennywise. Even with the almost three-hour runtime, I felt like some of the needed backstory was left out. We get hints at important character details, what's happened since the first film (especially Richie's character), but it still leaves many questions unanswered.There were a lot of great things about It Chapter Two. The casting for this film was phenomenal. It was easy to identify which child actor from the first film each adult actor was portraying. Bonus points and all the awards to whoever made the final casting decision on Richie (Finn Wolfhard/Bill Hader), Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor/Jay Ryan),"
202,MLS_Doc2_ItChapterTwo,MLS_Doc2_ItChapterTwo,MLS,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two,"It's been two years since we last visited the doomed town of Derry, Maine. The Losers Club, the most lovable group of misfits there is, has since grown up and left the sleepy town, but the evil hasn't. They are called back into action by Mike Hanlon, who remained as the town's librarian. It has returned, and it wants the Losers. This time, they have to kill It for good. Andy Muschietti's It Chapter One was a bit of a sleeper hit. It became the highest grossing horror film of all-time that no-one saw coming, because everyone hates sequels and reboots. But Muschietti had all the right ingredients to make his reboot work; a great cast and understanding that Stephen King's 'unfilmable' gigantic novel is actually about friendship, and the pain of growing up, rather than the killer clown everyone remembers the original miniseries for. Muschietti returns to the director's chair to craft a sequel that goes bigger and bolder in every sense, while digging deep into It's mythology, and the dynamic between the adult Losers. It's a mixed bag, and not everything works quite as smoothly as it did the first time. Muschietti also relies too much on CGI for scares and monsters, but in the end he regains a steady hand to bring the story to a satisfying, and a surprisingly emotional, close. As predicted, the cast is impeccable. It says a lot when James McAvoy is somehow the least charismatic on_screen presence; that's how stacked and good this cast is. McAvoy isn't bad per se, he's just left in the shadow of other equally talented actors. Especially good are Bill Hader and James Ransone as Richie and Eddie. The forever bickering friends steal the show, and every scene they are in. Hader is a revelation here, turning in one of the best performances of his career. He's laugh_out-loud funny, but his performance is always grounded in tragedy and self_hatred. Ransone gets possibly the flashiest role as the germaphobic Eddie. He gets to have the most fun but make no mistake, there's a lot bubbling under the surface. Eddie's insecurity, while at times played for laughs, is a tragic thing and the character's arc might just be the best of the film, along with Richie's. Jessica Chastain is great as Beverly but doesn't leave much of a mark, much like McAvoy. Both seem to be on autopilot, which still produces good performances, but forgettable ones. Jay Ryan, a relatively unknown Australian actor, makes a great Ben Hanscom, especially when he's pining for Beverly. But unfortunately the character is often just a root for fat jokes. Partly this is due to the source material, but considering it's 2019, one would hope Muschietti would have handled it with more grace and sensitivity. Muschietti certainly has a particular style of CGI he prefers,the overly fake look, and long, wonky faces. There's no effort to make It's iterations look realistic, but it's a strange choice, and one that distances the viewer from"

Pop culture's obsession with the painted jester has often seemed sinister, but back in 2016, something changed. A new craze had swept the world, with countless sightings of people dressed up as killer clowns, sometimes brandishing weapons and threatening passers-by. In California, one woman reported that a clown tried to snatch her baby daughter from her arms, while another man in Texas shared CCTV footage of a red-nosed prankster breaking into his home at night. They were crazy, unreal times. Enter It - the big-screen adaptation of Stephen King's classic 1986 novel.

Eddie's new wife resembles his overbearing mother, Beverly's husband is a copy of her abusive father and now-hunky Ben can't escape his formative years as a chubby target for bullies. Eventually, a devastating phone call threatens to pull them back to Derry where Pennywise awaits. Played by Bill Skarsgard, the clown prince of mime is on top form here. Stuffed with deliciously creepy scenes, the film's mid-section follows each character as they revisit their most terrifying encounters with Pennywise. By the time we reach the epic climax, we've met baby-faced crab-wasps, mouldy decapitated heads which sing in a fish tank and a dead friend's noggin suspended by huge, furry spider's legs. Director Andres Muschietti has been given full license to spook in this sequel - and It Chapter Two works best in its weirdest, most off-the-wall moments. Elsewhere, it's a smorgasbord of genres, packing in nods to history's greatest slasher, psychological, gross-out and zombie horrors. Love The Shining? You'll want to pay attention. There's even a hilarious Stephen King cameo, where the world's scariest writer plays a sassy antiques dealer in a Neil Young t-shirt. It's a horror nut's dream. Cast-wise, the film's famous stars don't always live up to their reputations. James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain are fine individually, but Bill and Beverly share little chemistry. At the same time, Isaiah Mustafa is unconvincing as Mike and James Ransome's quirky take on hypochondriac Eddie sometimes feels like an impression. Fortunately, none of this matters because Bill Hader is a revelation. Funny, compelling and often moving, the Superbad star steals every scene he's in - which is most of them. When Hader's on screen, the movie zips along with a levity that's missing in the drawn-out opening."

Home to baseball games and monsters hiding under the bleachers. Home to vibrant blue skies that go on forever and bullies that are psychotic rage monsters. Home to water filled quarries and an ancient evil that likes to dress up as a Elizabethan clown. It Chapter Two is set 27 years after the events of 2017's It. And if you remember your It mythology you know that It hibernates for 27 years and then returns to its murderous ways. Our plucky band of heroes took an oath at the end of the last chapter, promising to return if and when It rose again and, like all good promises made at the end of horror movies, it's time to turn in that marker. Let's get the annoyingly obvious question out of the way first. Is It Chapter Two as good as 2017's It? Well... nope. Me, I like the new movie. But it's missing the terror of the first movie, the nearly oppressive horror wrapped up in small town Americana tropes. And it's missing the simplicity of the first movie. 2017's It was 80s Stephen King stripped down, all the detours and side plots and coke influenced weirdness removed. No turtles, no uncomfortable adolescent group sex scenes. The beauty of 2017's It is that the filmmakers found the beating heart of a 1200 page novel and created something new and exciting out of that mix of terror of puberty, of loss, of guilt, and the rot at the soul of Americana artifice. It Chapter Two meanders more than its predecessor. There are anti-climatic side plots. There are bizarre subplots that are obviously not clearly thought out. There's more fat on its bones. It is long, so very long, and will test the patience of its target audience. The themes are not nearly as subtle in this chapter. And, again, it's just not as scary as the first film. But, I like It Chapter Two, despite its flaws. I have great love for the first film, but I do enjoy It Chapter Two. These two movies live in a place that I personally love, they share space with David Lynch films and Springsteen songs, with Pollock paintings, The Ramones, and Stephen King stories. They all share a theme, a suspicion that there is something rotten at the heart of the American Dream, that it doesn't take much to push someone from Rockwell painting to My Lai. But enough of that. Let's get back to what I like about It Chapter Two. I enjoy the meandering. Sure, I wish It Chapter Two was as streamlined as the first movie. 2017's It is like a 50s hot rod, stripped down to nothing but the essentials - frame, body, four tires, transmission and an engine. It Chapter Two is a crossover with a wifi hotspot, touch screens for everyone, and 7 backup"

Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa), the long remainder of the Loser's Club begins the arduous task of reminding the other 6 of their promise: if It returns, they'll return to fight. Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy) is a writer, even if his books have garbage endings. Beverly Marsh (Jessica Chastian) is a fashion designer, married to an abusive husband. Ritchie Tozier (Bill Hader) is a stand-up comedian, Eddie Kaspbrak (James Ransome) is a risk management adjuster, Stan Uris (Andy Bean) is an accountant, Ben Hanscomb (Jay Ryan) is an architect. All of them have shaken off the horror of Derry and gone on to be relatively successful and mildly happy if broken by their individual traumas. Mike alone has stayed, becoming the archivist for the horrors of Derry, unable to forget what happened and documenting the evil that has always lived in and under Derry, Maine. Unhappy that they've been summoned for more than a reunion, but unable to shake that Derry is someplace they have to be, they begin to remember the strong powerful youths they once were. They band together one last time to fight It (Bill Skarsgard), manifesting again as the terrifying clown Pennywise to lure the unwary and lonely to feast on their damaged bodies. It has issues of Its own. The Losers Club defeated It once before hibernating in 1989, and It wants them back, baiting Mike at a crime scene with a message written in blood: COME HOME COME HOME COME HOME. Pennywise tells them, ""For 27 years, I dreamt of you. I craved you... I've missed you!"". When they each search for the tokens that made them nearly invincible in 1989, It taunts them with fear and despair. It sends them one last curveball in the form of Henry Bowers (Teach Grant), because while supernatural monsters are scary, human monsters are unpredictable as well as terrifying. If you're expecting It Chapter Two to be bloodier and gorier and more adult, you won't be disappointed. It Chapter One (2017) dealt with childhood trauma and loss, Chapter Two zeros in on that unresolved trauma. Bill faces the guilt of losing his brother, Beverly squares with unrequited love and sexual abuse from basically every adult man in her life, Ritchie and Ben are deeply unhappy with an unrequited love story of their own, Eddie needs to see the forest and the trees with permission of his overbearing mother and then his wife before taking a step anywhere. Stan can never measure up or live beyond everyone else's expectations, Mike relives the loss of his parents and lives while Black in Podunk Derry, Maine. It is a deep plush tapestry of fear, loss, and terror, reminding us that our childhood bonds are often the strongest, even if we don't remember them. For those of you that remember the book, neither Tom Rogan nor Audra Denbrough shows up as wrenches in the Losers' grand scheme, and"

Knowing the possibility that he could return in 27 years, the group vows to come back to Derry if Pennywise every resurfaces. If that doesn't scream sequel nothing does. To be fair Stephen King's best-selling novel made a clear that a sequel was all but guaranteed. And it's not like the filmmakers weren't saying as much before the first ""It"" even hit theaters. And I'm sure Warner Bros. didn't mind making another film considering the first one brought in over $700 million against a modest $35 million budget. ""It: Chapter Two"" deals with the inevitable return of Pennywise after 27 years in hibernation. A new cast plays the all grown up ""Losers"" while the original cast returns playing their younger selves in numerous flashbacks. Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) ends up being the only one who stayed in Derry and when he sees signs of the killer clown's return he contacts the ""Losers"" to fulfill their oath. Strangely, with the exception of Mike, the group have forgotten key details of their friendship and their time in Derry. Turns out the further you get away from the town the less you remember. Bill (James McAvoy), Beverly (Jessica Chastain), Richie (Bill Hader), Ben (Jay Ryan), Eddie (James Ransone), and Stanley (Andy Bean) receive calls from Mike beginning their slow drip of returning memories. It also begins the film's overly long and cumbersome task of getting these characters from Point A to Point B while checking off a lot of boxes along the way. Navigating the unwieldy plot is just one of the problems effecting this overstuffed and wildly uneven sequel. The first film proved that these characters were at their best when they were together. ""Chapter Two"" fails to tap into that by keeping them apart for far too long. Take a long middle segment where each person goes out on their own to find their ""artifact"" hidden somewhere in Derry. It's meant to show them facing and overcoming a buried fear from their past, but it plays out like one staged horror set piece after another some. A couple are good including Beverly's despite it being completely spoiled in the trailers. Some are more interested in the grotesque while others are just ridiculous. A couple of moments do hit home particularly when the group discovers their old underground clubhouse. The scene blends together sequences of the young and old in a way that makes their friendships seem authentic and tangible. There is also a tender emotional tug from the movie's final few minutes that you can't help but be effected by despite the bumpy road to get there. A few other things contribute to this disappointing followup. Several aimless story-threads are introduced that literally go nowhere. There is a fizzling love triangle that is all but abandoned.

207,MLS_Doc7_ItChapterTwo,MLS_Doc7_ItChapterTwo,MLS,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two,"Size isn't everything. For nearly three hours, the epic-sized sequel It: Chapter Two attempts to mirror the length and girth of Stephen King's massive 1986 novel of 1,138 pages, one of the author's longest and most memorable works. After the incredible financial success of the first big-screen adaptation of It from 2017, which earned over $300 million in domestic receipts and even more at the international box-office, the sequel attempts to instill its own landmark quality with a long runtime. But director Andy Muschietti's unsophisticated treatment of the beloved pop-horror text fails to elevate the material to the exultant stature implied by its duration. As an author, King validated an admittedly ludicrous story-about adults grappling with horrific memories from their childhood experiences fighting an alien-clown named Pennywise-with his ability to immerse the reader in the inner psychology of his characters. Muschietti prefers to jolt his audience with cheap jump-scares, an ear-pummeling score, and gooey special FX more attuned to lowbrow schlock. At the same time, his characters, performed by an excellent cast, feel peripheral to the movie's spooky funhouse scares. Despite the luxurious 170-minute runtime, Chapter Two feels hastily assembled, oddly brief and bloated at the same time, and beneath the text on which it was based. Set 27 years after the events of its predecessor, Chapter Two opens with Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) having returned from his slumber in the bowels of Derry, Maine, where the Losers Club of reject teens once assembled to stop him. The adult Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) has never left Derry and thus has never forgotten his traumatic experiences fighting the child-murdering clown. In fact, he's spent nearly three decades at the local library, researching Derry's storied history to uncover a way to defeat Pennywise once and for all. This is all recounted for the viewer in Mike's banal voiceover, wrought with winking lines such as, ""Sometimes they come back"" (the name of a King short story). Eventually, Mike calls upon his former friends who made a blood oath as teens to reassemble in Derry should the creature ever return. Strangely enough, those who left their childhood town have forgotten what happened, meaning much of Chapter Two involves scenes that recall events from Chapter One. Then again, the sequel also entails the characters remembering new scenes from their childhood that the filmmakers couldn't fit in the 2017 movie. When Mike calls his friends to ask them to come home, Muschietti has fun reintroducing his audience to the adult version of the Losers Club. The stuttering former leader of their group, Bill (James McAvoy), has become a successful novelist who now toils in Hollywood under a fretting director (Peter Bogdanovich). The hypochondriacal Eddie (James Ransone) has found his calling as an insurance risk assessor, though he replaced his overprotective mother with an equally fussy wife. Likewise, Bev (Jessica Chastain) runs a successful fashion business, but she has replaced her abusive father with a marriage marked by domestic violence. The former ""fatboy"" Ben (Jay Ryan) has blossomed into"
208,MLS_Doc8_ItChapterTwo,MLS_Doc8_ItChapterTwo,MLS,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two,"Stephen King has been the go-to person for horror both on the page and on screen for well over 40 years. Just when you think his influence is going to wane, along comes a movie like 2017's IT that reminds people how effective his work can be when adapted by the right filmmakers. The book IT was split almost evenly between the younger and adult versions of the gang known as The Losers, so it was inevitable that IT: Chapter Two would come along, given the success of the first film. Taking place 27 years later, the film follows the grown-up Losers - Beverly (Jessica Chastain), Bill (James McAvoy), Richie (Bill Hader), Ben (Jay Ryan), Eddie (James Ransone), and Stanley (Andy Bean) - when they are called back to Derry, Maine, by Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) after Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) re-emerges from the sewers. Mike has spent his adulthood obsessively trying to figure out how to get rid of Pennywise once and for all, while the rest of the group has managed to somewhat put their childhood trauma behind them. All of it comes rushing back upon their return, and Mike challenges each of them to do their part to end the scourge of the scary clown. The first film had one big thing working for it that is limited in the sequel. The '80s nostalgia and group of kids banding together to fight a supernatural being played much the same card as the Netflix show Stranger Things, especially given the presence of actor Finn Wolfhard in both. The perceived innocence and precociousness of the kids lent that film a feeling that Chapter Two can't replicate, even though it relies somewhat heavily on flashbacks to the kids. Another unintended consequence of the transition from childhood to adulthood is that Pennywise doesn't come across as scary anymore. He and the weird waking nightmares he creates are creepy, to be sure, but everything about him is too strange to be frightening. As the film reaches its third hour - more on that in a second - the only natural reaction to the craziness and mayhem on screen is laughter, even when it's not intended. Director Andy Muschietti and writer Gary Dauberman were apparently given carte blanche after the first film made more than $700 million worldwide, and to say they take advantage is an understatement. They spend significant time alone with each major character, an idea that may have seemed good in theory but is deadly in practice. Clocking in at 2 hours and 49 minutes, the film is much too long to be effective. A movie like this needs to build up tension, and by letting the plot breathe so much, the filmmakers let all the air out of Pennywise's menacing balloons. The cast winds up being much better than the material as a whole. Much like Sophia Lillis was as Beverly in the first film, Chastain is the best thing about the sequel. McAvoy gets to try on yet another accent"
209,MLS_Doc9_ItChapterTwo,MLS_Doc9_ItChapterTwo,MLS,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two,"The first instalment of ""It,"" Stephen King's scary clown epic, was about overcoming fears. Specifically, the shape-shifting Pennywise the Dancing Clown a.k.a. It (Bill Skarsgard), the manifestation of all the character's fears. The new film, inventively titled ""It: Chapter Two,"" is about resilience, about sticking your neck out for your friends. The new one is set in 2016, 27 years after the preteen Loser's Club battled Pennywise in his sewer lair and kept the town of Derry, Maine safe from the child gobbling monster. Now, the childhood friends have gone their separate ways. Loser's leader Bill (James McAvoy) is now a successful mystery novelist. Sexual abuse survivor Beverly (Jessica Chastain) went on to become a fashion designer, while Ben (Jay Ryan), the overweight, bullied kid is now an architect living in Nebraska and loud-mouth Richie (Bill Hader) is a comedian in Los Angeles. Other members fled town as well. Hypochondriac Eddie (James Ransone) is a risk analyst and Stanley (Andy Bean) is now an Atlanta-based accountant. Only Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) stayed in Derry. Traumatized by the events of his youth he battles a substance abuse problem but stays on top of Pennywise's existence by sleeping next to a police scanner. ""Something happens when you leave this town,"" says Mike. ""The farther away, the hazier it all gets. But me, I never left. I remember all of it."" When trouble in the form of a clown comes back to town Mike summons the others Losers to come back home to conquer their fears, bond together and do battle with their old foe. ""Did you miss me?"" taunts Pennywise. ""No one wants to play with me anymore."" At almost three hours ""It: Chapter Two"" is an overindulgent mish mash, part horror, a splash of comedy and heaping helping of pop psychology. Oh, and a clown. To say the movie takes its time is an understatement along the lines of suggesting Pennnywise floss more often. It almost feels like you're binging several episodes of a serialized version of the story without the benefit of being able to switch channels when the going gets repetitive. And it gets repetitive. We are endlessly reminded of the character's childhood traumas, told of Pennywise's evil and if someone said to me, ""We've got to stick together,"" as many times Bill says it here, I would make a run for it and never look back. The movie says it best when Ritchie exasperatedly says, ""We're caught up, OK!"" over an hour in, and yet the exposition and repetition continues. There are several striking nightmarish images and Hader provides some much-needed comic relief but it feels as though director Andy Muschietti and screenwriter Gary Dauberman regarded King's novel as some sort of sacred text and were unable to stray from the written word. One of the enjoyable things about King's novels is his world-building, his attention to detail and skill for weaving mythology into real(ish) world situations. The best adaptations of his work carefully parse these elements to boil"
210,MLS_Doc10_ItChapterTwo,MLS_Doc10_ItChapterTwo,MLS,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two,"It Chapter Two, director Andy Muschietti's followup to 2017's wildly successful It, is a baffling hodgepodge of half-baked ideas. Every time the film has an interesting choice to make, it makes the wrong one, squandering its stellar cast and Stephen King's rich mythology. Frustratingly overlong and exceedingly myopic, It Chapter Two is one of this year's most disappointing horror blockbusters. It Chapter Two begins with a hate crime. Lifted straight from Stephen King's novel, the film opens with the savage beating of a gay couple by a group of homophobic teens. The more unfortunate of the two, the asthmatic Adrian Mellon, is dumped over a bridge into the river, where an even more gruesome death awaits him at the hands of the primordial evil, Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard). The scene is quite indicative of how misguided It Chapter Two is, but not for the reasons you might think. Yes, disgusting slurs are slung, and yes, this is a harrowing and triggering depiction of a violent hate crime, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't have a place in the story. In fact, pretty much everyone involved with the film acknowledges the scene's thematic importance - its prescient weight. Jessica Chastain, who plays the adult version of Beverly Marsh, perhaps conveyed it best in an interview with Variety: ""I think you need that scene because [King] writes about the darkness that's under the surface, the dirt under the fingernails of these small towns or of mankind. That's what It represents. It's the darkness of human behavior."" The cameo casting of gay filmmaker and activist Xavier Dolan as Adrian Mellon seems to underline the scene's potential resonance, and Stephen King himself has implied that Pennywise represents the dark underbelly of humanity, an undying force that both amplifies and feeds off our basest evils. So why does it feel so perfunctory? It Chapter Two is far from a homophobic movie, but it still has no idea how to extrapolate its own opening scene beyond a violent reintroduction of the series' villain. And the film's shortsightedness isn't limited to just its subtext - at every crossroads, creatively and narratively, It Chapter Two makes wrong decisions. Picking up 27 years after the first film, It Chapter Two centers around the return of the Losers Club to Derry, Maine. Having banished Pennywise into the void back in 1988, an adult Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa) - the one member of the Club who never left town - is the first to sense the return of the eldritch evil in 2016. Invoking the blood pact made all those years ago, Mike reaches out to Bill (James McAvoy), Beverly (Jessica Chastain), Richie (Bill Hader), Eddie (James Ransome), Ben (Jay Ryan), and Stanley (Andy Bean), recruiting them once again to kill Pennywise. Either due to magic or mystical - the film never elaborates - all of the wayward members of the gang have mostly forgotten their adventures when they were children, with their traumatic memories returning only after making their way"

The modern visual rules for these shots were set by Stanley Kubrick's ""2001,"" which used a detailed model moving slowly instead of a cheesy model moving fast. Kubrick had the good sense to know that sound does not travel in space, but ""Star Wars,"" with its deep bass rumbles, demonstrated that it certainly should. And then in the ""Alien"" and ""Star Trek"" pictures and in countless others, gigantic space cruisers aimed majestically at the stars, and I felt an inner delight that has its origins in those long-ago days when I devoured pulp space opera by Robert Heinlein and such forgotten masters as Murray Leinster and Eric Frank Russell. My state of mind is best captured by a pulp mag that was defunct even before I started reading science fiction: ""Thrilling Wonder Stories,"" without doubt the best title in the history of magazines. I hope for strange and amazing adventures. Sometimes I am gratified. More often I am disappointed. ""Pitch Black,"" which begins in deep space and ends with a manhunt on a desert planet, falls somewhere in between: clever, done with skill, yet lacking in the cerebral imagination of the best science fiction. How sad it is that humans travel countless light years away from Earth, only to find themselves inhabiting the same tired generic conventions. The movie begins during an interstellar mission, with the crew and a dangerous prisoner all in cryo-sleep. The ship collides with a cluster of rock fragments, which penetrate the hull like BBs through cellophane. The captain and several other sleepers are terminally perforated, and Fry (Radha Mitchell) assumes command. The ship crash-lands on a planet that circles somehow within a three-star system, where at least one sun never seems to set, and the surviving crew members have to fight it out with the vicious and cunning prisoner Riddick (Vin Diesel). You may remember Diesel from ""Saving Private Ryan,"" where he was the hard-bitten Pvt. Caparzo. He looks like a mean customer, and he is. He shares no fellow feeling with the other survivors, expresses no responsibility to them, does not consider himself in the same boat and thinks only of escaping. Oh, and his eyes have a remarkable quality: He can see in the dark. Not a very useful ability on a planet with three suns and no night, right? (Hollow laugh.) What disappointed me about ""Pitch Black,"" directed by David Twohy, is that it didn't do more with its alien world, and less with its recycled human conflicts. I feel underwhelmed when humans land on another world and are so quickly reduced to jumping out from behind rocks at one another and playing hostage games. ""Pitch Black"" does have a nice look, all bleached blues and desert sands. And there are some promising story elements, one of which I am about to discuss, so you might want to set this review aside if you plan to see the"
212,OSO_Doc2_PitchBlack,OSO_Doc2_PitchBlack,OSO,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch Black,"If you ever wondered what it might feel like to be inside a spaceship cracking apart during a violent crash landing, Pitch Black gives you the experience bright and early. The camera jiggles around spasmodically, the actors shout unintelligible gibberish at each other, the sound hammers us. Unfortunately, this describes too much of the rest of the movie, too, without a crash landing as an excuse. Pitch Black is yet another insecure hissy fit of a movie - a thriller without enough confidence in itself or its characters to calm down for two seconds and let the actors speak to each other like human beings. Movies like this copy the who-goes-there thrills of Alien and John Carpenter's The Thing without those films' grubby, everyday, human-scaled group dynamics. Here, the spaceship in question is carrying a motley crew mostly headed for someplace called ""New Mecca""; in addition to the expected Muslims (led by Keith David, of The Thing), there's a geologist, an antiques collector, a morphine-addicted cop, a teenage boy who's not what he seems, and a serial killer. This all smacks of gimmickry - these aren't people, they're conflict units. In Alien and The Thing, the people confined together were allowed personalities which could then flare up. The only people in Pitch Black with anything resembling a personality are the serial killer, Riddick (Vin Diesel), and the ship's pilot, Fry (Radha Mitchell), whose soft features juxtapose nicely with her tough nature. Mostly, the people wander around on the parched, godforsaken rock they've landed on, squabbling over how to escape, while gradually being picked off by slithering monsters who thrive on darkness. Of course, this planet has three suns and thus no darkness, but wouldn't you just know a total eclipse happens to be approaching? Pitch Black does have an imaginative look. Whenever the characters step outside into the alien air, cinematographer David Eggby (Mad Max) bleaches out everything, which makes sense: These are alien suns whose light is passing through an alien atmosphere, so of course things will look different. And I liked how Riddick, whose eyes have been doctored to allow him to see in the dark, emerges as the unlikely hero who alone can see the ravenous monsters. The Riddick's-eye view of the beasts is a neat touch of psychedelia. Problem is, you may wish you could see through Riddick's eyes all the time. Pitch Black, like so many other horror movies in recent years, is too often so dimly lit that you can't tell what's going on. Yes, the latter half unfolds during an eclipse, but a film can be dark and still be visible (perfect example: Carpenter's Halloween). The expensive, computer-generated creatures lurk around in the dark, revealed to us only in teasing flashes - perhaps for the best, considering that what we do see looks heavily indebted to H.R. Giger's Alien/Species designs. And the editing, as usual, is far too jangled; if you don't like a shot, wait two seconds and it'll change. I always"

The last film produced by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, the production was completed for $23 million, and it more than doubled its returns at the worldwide box office. Its modest performance nonetheless announced the arrival of Vin Diesel's action hero stardom; before this and Boiler Room (released on the same day as Pitch Black), Diesel's notable credits consisted of only a small supporting role in Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998) and voicework on Brad Bird's animated gem The Iron Giant (1999). Twohy's movie didn't make Diesel a household name, but it's something both he and his fans have returned to over the years. Many discovered Pitch Black on home video, while Diesel later teamed with Twohy to continue the adventures of the movie's anti-hero, Riddick. Jim and Ken Wheat wrote the screenplay along with Twohy, and the result derives influence from every notable sci-fi classic of the last fifty years. The movie opens with a spacecraft moving steadily through the blackness of space, recalling those iconic shots from Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and later Star Wars (1977). Space debris penetrates the hull, and the craft begins to descend into the atmosphere of a nearby planet. With the captain killed in the chaos, pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) considers jettisoning some forty passengers in cryo-sleep so she might survive. She doesn't, and in the ensuing crash, less than a dozen make it. Among the survivors are the Muslim Imam (Keith David), the would-be cop Johns (Cole Hauser), a boy named Jack (Rhiana Griffith), the antiquities dealer Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), and a detained killer named Richard B. Riddick (Diesel). Stranded on a desert planet that has three suns and perpetual sunlight, the survivors pool their resources and head out into the surrounding nothingness to search for water. But the search becomes secondary after the escape of Riddick, a killer whose murderous ways are confirmed by Johns and never denied in Riddick's monosyllabic retorts. Still, we know he's the hero because he's the one narrating. He's eventually caught after one of the survivors mysteriously dies, although he insists he's not responsible. ""All you people are so scared of me."" Diesel's character rumbles. ""Most days, I'd take that as a compliment. But it ain't me you gotta worry about now."" Indeed, traveling with Riddick as their captive, they come upon a leftover science camp in which they find no signs of human life-but they do find large, carnivorous, nocturnal batlike creatures that remain hidden in a web of underground tunnels. Worse, as the camp's former geologists learned, they're about to witness a planetary eclipse that only occurs every 22 years and lasts nearly a month, meaning the dark-dwelling creatures can finally emerge from their slumber to feed. This nonsensical but otherwise intriguing idea comes with plenty of scientific questions, such as how do these"

All have their own dark secrets and hidden pasts. The survivors soon discover an abandoned geologic research station nearby. All of the scientists are gone, and we quickly find out why. Bizarre, bat-like nocturnal creatures live under the ground in the dark. They seem to be very hungry, too, and the scientists were their last meal. Take a creature from Aliens, mix it with a bat, a panther, and a hammerhead shark and you have these critters. There are also smaller, faster flying versions, too. The survivors realize they must stick together if they will make it off the planet, however most all of them are selfish in their own way. The motto of the group seems to be 'Let's stick together, because when the monsters come I only have to run faster than you to get away!' Can they make it out alive? They must transport some power cells to a small spacecraft at the outpost in order to get off the planet. But (and there's always a 'but') a rare eclipse of the three suns takes place and the planet becomes dark. The creatures then come out in force and the race to get away is on.

I wanted a good popcorn flick with cool effects and a lot of action, and that's what I got. The plot is not particularly deep, but for what it sets out to do, it does well. The cast was well chosen. Vin Diesel was excellent as the prisoner Riddick. He's tough, he's mean, and he's definitely no good guy, but you begin to like him nevertheless. Diesel played the part very well and I'd definitely like to see him play this character again. I think he'd be great in other action flicks. The rest of the cast did good jobs as well. The special effects weren't ground breaking caliber, but they were still good. The ship crash had some excellent moments and there is one particular scene where the creatures take flight at the beginning of the eclipse that is memorable. A really beautiful shot as clouds of the creatures swarm in the sky with the eclipse as a background. To make the planet a little more otherworldly, colored filters were used to give everything"
215,OSO_Doc5_PitchBlack,OSO_Doc5_PitchBlack,OSO,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black,"Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel) can't seem to remain unconscious in cryosleep like the other 40 or more civilians and officers resting stationarily in their chambers aboard a space transport. He's the only prisoner of the group, which prompts him to contemplate the many opportunities for escape that may present themselves over the course of the 41-week journey. When a meteor shower causes excessive damage, causing the crew to be automatically awoken prematurely, Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) inherits a command position after learning that Captain Tom Mitchell has perished. And then a tumultuous crash-landing plunges them all into darkness. With the back half of the ship torn away, it's obvious that the desert planet (boasting three suns) on which they stumbled will be their new home for some time. William Johns (Cole Hauser) is in charge of Riddick, who poses a conundrum, as he'd previously broken out of a maximum-security prison. Blindfolded and gagged, Riddick is additionally chained to a beam; but it's not enough to hold the man forever. A handful of survivors scour the wreckage, gather usable supplies, and hope to locate water - but they have more pressing things to worry about as well, such as the ravenous indigenous life. The sets are instantly amusing, though they're obscured by a precise color scheme that turns the imagery black-and-white with hints of various tints. Shadowy locales are bluish, while sun-scorched sand dunes are yellow; other colors are virtually nonexistent. If it didn't feel as if utilized to hide mediocre special effects, the palette might have been more effective. Distorted images, slow-motion in unnecessary moments, repeated camera angles, and rapid cuts also generate visual curiosities, which numb the effectiveness of the cinematography and action-oriented violence. Nevertheless, the exploration of the planet holds additional intrigue, particularly as the unprepared passengers investigate abandoned outposts and encounter other inhabitants. ""All you people are so scared of me. Most days I take that as a compliment. But it ain't me you gotta worry about now."" ""Pitch Black"" isn't smart sci-fi; instead, it's boilerplate survival horror, preoccupied with death, destruction, and monsters. Likewise, it's the type of thriller that employs a muscular hero and capable female sidekicks with obligatorily bared midriffs. There's also a curious subplot about idolizing Riddick's notoriety, with two teenaged survivors emulating his dress and demeanor - which doesn't quite fit with the rest of the action. Fortunately, this leads to a couple of surprises (chiefly in the order of demises), which proves a certain level of storytelling bravery from writer/director David Twohy. The dependence on CG antagonists, however, is a pity, as they doesn't hold up nearly as well as practical models (plus, inconsistencies abound with the designs, principally when the aliens swarm in the millions yet attack in small groups, perhaps a dozen at a time). This is true of the bloodshed, too, whose creativity suffers from unconvincing executions. The suspense fares better, especially when the characters are hunted down one by one in the inky confines of spaceship"
216,OSO_Doc6_PitchBlack,OSO_Doc6_PitchBlack,OSO,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black,"As usual, one of the best films of the year is getting only a miniature release. For a while Pitch Black looked like it wasn't going to screen in the UK at all. Once, when I called its distributor in America, they pretended they hadn't even heard of it (""There's someone on the phone asking about Titch Clack""). It's a low-ish budget sci-fi flick shot in Australia, in the same area where Mad Max was filmed. This place, Coober Pedy, is usually boiling hot, but during filming it rained like crazy and the wind blew. This not only made for a hellish shoot (good - the cast look suitably stretched and panicked), it also forced the director David Twohy to bleach the negative and literally white-out all the angry clouds. He had to do this because Pitch Black is supposedly set on a sun-scorched planet. A ship crash-lands with most of its human cargo intact, including the co-pilot (Radha Mitchell) and a convicted murderer (Vin Diesel) who has creepy night-vision lenses implanted into his retinae. At first things are OK. They're thirsty, but plucky. Mitchell strides around with her long legs and serious face, the sweat on her neck making her hair curl into tight balls. Then someone gets eaten by a creature that appears to be cave-dwelling, capable of chewing through humans as though they were a wodge of brie, but terrified of light. Fine. It never gets dark on this planet. Or so they think! The film looks dangerously bright and burnt-out, so much so that I instinctively narrowed my eyes as though the screen were one enormous sun-lamp. In general, the production feels almost rush-job simple - in science fiction this isn't necessarily a bad thing. We are spared the ubiquitous, post- Blade Runner, apocalyptic monologue (Diesel tries, but his ginormous arms and dancer's waist are too distracting). Instead, the cast chug about, screaming bad news and sound advice at each other, while creatures pour out of flutes in the earth, like pollution from Industrial Revolution chimneys. It is unbelievably frightening. As it gets dark, the whole landscape of the planet seems inflected with horror, as though it were a shark-filled sea. The crew must take on the never-ending night, and therefore, in a sense, time itself. Bedazzled stars Brendan Fraser as a kindly twerp who is approached by Elizabeth Hurley claiming to be the Devil and wearing what could pass for a dress. In exchange for his soul, Fraser is granted seven wishes. Cue a succession of occasionally funny scenarios in which our hero turns into a trilingual drug baron (the rich wish), a hulking sports star (the sexy wish), and so on. By wish five, the film's prosaic rhythm (wish, disaster, wish, disaster) irritates. And then there's Liz, with her Joanna Lumley briskness, and her supply of small red outfits. Hurley's true analogue here is Barbara Woodhouse. She talks to everyone as though she's training them, including us. It's all done through a mouth so"

I like to go with the flow - watch what I want, ignore what doesn't interest me, and that's it. But if there is one thing I genuinely miss, it's the period where decently budgeted, high concept creature-features could be made and given wide theatrical releases. And they were mainstream! Every once in a while one may slip through the cracks (Alexandre Aja's Crawl and the 47 Meters Down films being recent examples) but for the most part this type of theatrical experience is dead. David Twohy's Pitch Black just recently celebrated its 22nd birthday this year, and I think it's time to celebrate the unlikely franchise-starter for being a damn good sci-fi/horror film that first introduced the cult favorite anti-hero, Riddick. By the time Pitch Black dropped David Twohy had already been in the game for quite some time. His first Hollywood writing credit is for Critters 2: The Main Course and from there he went on to write the cult classic Warlock and has credits for everything ranging from The Fugitive to G.I. Jane to Waterworld. Pitch Black was his third time in the director's chair after helming Timescape and The Arrival. Working from an initial script given over for him to tinker with, Twohy rewrote the film to amp it up into its own beast. There is a distinctive hard-edge, no-nonsense quality to Pitch Black that makes it very appealing. There is a dose of John Carpenter-esque cynicism to the story and characters here that feel right at home alongside films like Escape from New York and The Thing. A transport vessel cruising the backwaters of the space lanes is struck by a rogue asteroid, causing it to crash on a desolate planet scorching under perpetual daylight. The ship was transporting dozens of individuals in cryosleep - everything from holy men on a pilgrimage to one hell of a dangerous convict by the name of Richard B. Riddick - Vin Diesel's breakout, and in my opinion, best role. In their struggle to figure out a way off the planet, the survivors soon find out that they arrived just in time for the planet's nightfall 22 years in the making-and with the darkness comes the monsters. Their only hope of getting off the planet relies on the killer they all fear. Riddick can see in the dark. Can a monster save them from other monsters? High concept premises like this almost always hinge on the characters, and Twohy manages to craft a handful of them that refreshingly break the mold they initially seem to occupy. Our lead, Fry (Radha Mitchell) is hiding a secret from the rest of the survivors - that she almost jettisoned them into space to save her own ass. The cop transporting Riddick, Johns (Cole Hauser) turns out not to be a cop at all, but a mercenary with a drug addiction"
218,OSO_Doc8_PitchBlack,OSO_Doc8_PitchBlack,OSO,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch Black,"Bottom line: I don't understand how this awful, painful movie started a franchise. The movie opens with a tour of a transport spaceship. Almost all of the passengers are in cryogenic-like sleep pods. Yadda yadda yadda the ship crashes on some desert planet. When the however-many-suns-this-planet-has set, swarms of vicious, flying, aliens come out from the subterranean depths to hunt in the...pitch-black night. One of the [many] things that disappointed me about Pitch Black was the design of the alien. Initially, I was excited. I thought we weren't actually going to get to see the aliens; it is called ""pitch black"" after all. Unfortunately, we see the little hammerhead things early and often. It's too bad we see them too because, even though this movie is from 2000, the CGI has not aged well. I'm used to seeing ""criminal"" protagonists who turn out to be misunderstood or noble rebels especially when the protagonist is Vin Diesel. Has he ever been a bad guy? Well, in Pitch Black, he is a super criminal/murderer who is being transported to some prison colony-planet. Over time, as these protagonists do, they bond with their fellow travelers. Diesel has a tendency to do this in his other roles, namely, The Fast and The Furious, where he is the kindhearted hijacker, Dom. In Pitch Black, it seems like he is going to be that type of character; he saves this character who does something stupid and that character who puts himself in danger. At almost the end of the movie, all of a sudden, he drops the act to become a villain...only to turn around to do the right thing. If they were trying to make him an antihero, they weren't successful nor were they successful at making him the anything more than a generic action figure. Vin Diesel makes me laugh because he is so serious about his roles. I've mentioned that about Tom Cruise in my previous reviews. I appreciate it when an actor is determined to do a ludicrous scene with the utmost dedication. In Pitch Black, for example, Riddick's hands are handcuffed behind his back around a steel beam. He looks up to see a break in the beam. I can imagine his thought process: ""if only I could flip up somehow and slip the cuffs thr- oh, better idea, I'll just dislocate my shoulders and slip them through the space."" Overall, I really disliked almost everything about this movie. I already talked about Riddick but I wasn't any fan of any of the other cookie cutter characters. There's the token love interest, the punk kid (who I'll discuss in a bit), Riddick's white male rival, weasel-like male character (who looks oddly like Quentin Tarantino), the expendable (less attractive) female character, and the token minority character and his two kids. I did have some fun picking out which characters would die (and in what order). I'd recommend you try it if you find yourself strapped to a chair and forced to watch"

SEX/NUDITY 2 - Some sexual innuendo. Two women wear cleavage- and midriff-revealing shirts throughout the movie (in one scene, a woman's cleavage is particularly noticeable while she's on her hands and knees in front of the camera). VIOLENCE/GORE 8 - A person is shot several times (lots of blood sprays onto someone near by) and another's back is slashed (the long, bloody cut is visible). Someone is pulled into a hole and presumably eaten (we see blood on his face before he disappears, then see blood surrounding the hole). Creatures attack several people, but due to lots of quick cuts with the camera no explicit gore is visible unless otherwise noted: creatures fly away with a person's body, a creature grabs a person's neck and pulls the body up a wall, a creature stabs someone and then flies off with the body (we see blood dripping into a puddle), a creature impales someone (this is seen in an ""infrared"" shot) and then bites the person's head, a creature bites a person's leg (some blood is visible) and from a distance we see creatures feeding on a corpse (this is also seen in an ""infrared"" shot). In a long, chaotic scene of a space ship crash-landing, a man is impaled by a pole (we later see the bloody pole sticking out of his chest and hear him screaming in pain as he dies), people fall to the ground and are struck by objects, the windshield of the ship is shattered (it breaks into a woman's face, but she's not cut) and the ship catches on fire; parts of the ship rip off when it hits the ground. A man slices a creature (squishy noises are heard) and pieces of it fall to the ground; a few creatures are shot at. A creature's sharp claw nearly stabs a man's head. Creatures fight with each other while flying; pieces of them fall to the ground and their blue-colored blood falls on people below. We see a close-up of a creature bubbling when it's exposed to light. A man chokes another with a metal wire. Some punches and kicks and several scuffles and struggles in which people are shoved or thrown to the ground; in one scene, a woman tackles a man, who then flips her and holds a knife to her throat. A man injects a drug into his eye duct (we see a close-up of this). We hear cracking noises when a man intentionally dislocates his shoulders and then rolls them back into place.

I've watched most of the films now for my Halloween Horror Fest and just have to finish writing up the rest of the reviews. I've loved a couple and hated a couple. I didn't love Pitch Black. There was a lot of talk about Pitch Black as whatever number Riddick sequel thingy was out recently so I decided to finally check out Pitch Black after reading the following reviews for both of them: I hold none of these people responsible for making me watch Pitch Black. It was entirely my decision to watch a Vin Diesel movie! My Opinion on Pitch Black: The most positive thing I can say about it is that it definitely had potential. It COULD have been a pretty good film. And some of it LOOKED pretty cool, at least. One of my all-time favorite movies is Aliens (and Alien). I'm not going to be able to help but compare Pitch Black to Aliens throughout this review as it's basically Aliens but shit. Take out all the things about Aliens that make it such an awesome film and you get Pitch Black. The characters in Pitch Black were, for me, the film's biggest weakness. I didn't care about them at ALL. I don't know who the hell they even were or why they were on this ship. But I'll come back to all that later... Okay, the characters of Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) & Jack (Rhiana Griffith) weren't TOO bad - they were the only ones I maybe (kind of sort of) wanted to survive. Jack is the only somewhat likeable character and Fry would be if it wasn't for something that happens at the beginning of the film (But it's pretty important when it comes to what happens at the end of the film so I didn't have a problem with that. In fact, this little bit of story was the only thing that gave one of the characters a bit of depth whereas none of the others had any at all). And RIDDICK? What a horrible movie character. And the sequels are all about him? Um, no thanks - I'll be skipping those. You see, he's a ""prisoner"". I have no idea what the hell he did or why the hell he's on this spaceship. I don't know if he's a bad guy who's actually kind of a good guy. I don't know what he says half the time because I can't understand him. I don't know anything about him at the start of the film and still don't know anything at the end of the film. What's the point? Are we meant to like him? Are we meant to hate him?

221,NTF_Doc1_US,NTF_Doc1_US,NTF,Horror,Positive,US,"After the enormous success of ""Get Out"" writer-director Jordan Peele found himself the object of near universal acclaim. Since the earliest screenings of his sophomore effort ""Us"" the acclamation has only intensified. He has already been heralded as ""the new Hitchcock"" and ""the next Spielberg"". And one blurb has christened his newest movie ""The Best Horror Film of All Time"". That's an absurd level of praise and completely unfair to a filmmaker with only two movies under his belt. ""Get Out"" was a movie full of big ideas but hardly what you would call groundbreaking execution. The sheer audacity of its story seemed to be enough for most people to overlook its gaping plot holes and third act sloppiness. ""Us"", same genre but a much different movie, suffers from none of those same problems. In fact, it turns out to be a fascinating melange of smart, well-measured comedy and straight-forward psychological horror but with a host of extra flavors tossed in. Most importantly, it's a wonderfully original bit of horror which is something the genre is always in need of. Peele begins his chilling and twisted tale with a really well crafted prologue set in 1986. On the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk a young girl named Adelaide wanders off from her parents and into a rinky-dink funhouse. She's found there shortly after but not before a traumatizing encounter leaves her shaken to the core. Jump ahead to the present day. A grown-up Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) arrives at her family's lakeside vacation home with her garrulous and daffy husband Gabe (Winston Duke), their early-stage teen rebel daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), and their precocious young son Jason (Evan Alex). Adelaide hasn't shared her childhood trauma with Gabe who is understandably confused when she pushes back on his plans for an afternoon at Santa Cruz Beach. Adelaide gives in and they head to the beach to hang out with fellow upper middle-classers Josh and Kitty Tyler (played by Tim Heidecker and Elizabeth Moss) and their two snooty daughters. But when Jason wanders off it's deja vu for Adelaide. She finds her son but is clearly rattled and the family outing is cut short. Back at the lakehouse Adelaide and Gabe are hashing it out when Jason notices a creepy family lurking in the driveway. If you've seen the trailers you know these aren't just pesky neighbors. They're doppelgangers - ghoulish copies of Adelaide and her family. But what do they want and where are they from? I'd be doing a major disservice if I went any further because the less you know the better the experience. Let's just say the terror kicks in and ""Us"" takes the early form of a home invasion flick. But as it ventures further down Peele's rabbit hole it slyly and in some instances gruesomely branches into several frightening new directions. This is also where Peele's interest in duality comes fully into focus. It's seen not only within the narrative and the characters but also the cast"
222,NTF_Doc2_US,NTF_Doc2_US,NTF,Horror,Positive,US,"In 2017, Jordan Peele entered the spotlight as one of Hollywood's great new directors with the release of Get Out, a film that used horror as a backdrop to refract race relations in today's America. Smart modern usage of the genre that catapulted the director to an Academy Award win for Best Original Screenplay. While Get Out is out to send a powerful message, the film's finale fails to stick its landing in categorizing it as one of the greats of the 2010s. This opinion stems from the film's final 20 minutes. While the first 80 minutes focus on race relations and strays away from a conventional horror film, its climax turns into a cliche including an uneven turn where brain surgery is the source of the events that have taken place throughout the narrative. Two years later, Jordan Peele has returned with his sophomore outing, Us, a thought-provoking excursion that is nothing short of a colossal cinematic achievement. Peele's new film is both darker and more ambitious, and broader in its themes and immediately enters the category of a modern day masterpiece. What makes Us so unique is it can bypass the concept of genre and make the audience sit, think, and create a mindset and opinion about what the theme of this film is. Similarly to classics such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (a sci-fi film), The Godfather Parts 1 and 2 (a crime drama), Us falls under the horror genre but it's so much more than that. Like the previously mentioned classics, the film creates conversations and debate among moviegoers as to what Peele is trying to tell us. On the surface, the film is positioned as a home-invasion style horror film. Add in Peele's creative mind and Us rises above its horror genre definition. The film's real purpose is to look at the big picture of cultural consciousness and the cultural unconscious. The ""moral compass"" that lies in all of us that is quick to create an opinion of someone without knowing all the facts. Us is the self-examination of a human being. Along with Peele's direction, Winston Duke, Shahadi Wright Joseph, and Evan Alex should be commended for their duel performances. Duke continues to show why he is on the rise as one of Hollywood's consistent actors. From Black Panther to Us, Duke shows no signs of being typecast and will not shy away from accepting new roles which will add to the depth of his repertoire. While Joseph and Alex can differentiate, both parts played in a way where compassion can still be had for both roles each of these child actors took in the film. Did I miss someone? Oh yes, then there's Lupita Nyong'o's take as Adelaide/Red. A year ago, cinephiles were craving for an Academy Award nomination for the brutally raw performance by Toni Collette in Hereditary. While the nomination failed to come to fruition, there is a sense that Lupita is on her way to break the horror genre Oscar"

Peele has solidified himself as one of the most important and pensive artists of the current generation and beyond, and he's firing on all cylinders with his sophomore film. The themes and ideas put forth are grander and more all-encompassing than Get Out - this winds up being both good and bad, but the sheer ambition and genius behind it all continues to be mightily impressive. In 1986, a young girl named Adelaide (Madison Curry) is on vacation at the Santa Cruz boardwalk with her parents. Adelaide wanders off while the adults are distracted, as children are prone to do, and winds up exploring a house of mirrors on the beach. What she encounters in there is enough to scar her for life, so much to the point that she's unable to speak for a considerable amount of time afterwards. Jump to the present day, and a fully grown Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) is returning to Santa Cruz and facing her fears, along with her husband, Gabe (Winston Duke), and their two children, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex). What starts off as a fun and refreshing vacation immediately turns into a violent and terrifying nightmare. Four strangers, clad in matching red jumpsuits and each wielding large scissors, show up at the family's summer home, and they have a thirst for blood. The scariest part? They look exactly like them. Peele is paying homage to the classic horror flicks of the 80s here, and he proudly scatters references and stages scenes inspired by them throughout his film. A young Adelaide wanders the dark beach in an oversized Michael Jackson's Thriller tee, Jason rocks a Jaws shirt for most of the movie, and a news report echoes the feelings of Night of the Living Dead. There's no shortage of scares to experience in Us, the most notable being the home invasion sequence that's dominated most of the marketing. The use of darkness, tight spaces, and angles drive home the fact that the Wilsons are trapped and the walls are both literally and figuratively closing in. Us is far more creepy and unsettling than Get Out was, due in large part to phenomenal performances from the cast pulling double duty, and the violence is on par with the best slasher films. Nyong'o dominates the screen as both Adelaide and her sinister counterpart, playing each role so drastically differently and relying not solely on a change of voice but a change of physicality, that you'd swear they were inhabited by different actors. Adelaide is a former ballerina, and thus moves with speed, grace, and lightness, but her shadow moves in very staticky and jerky movements, more like a machine"
224,NTF_Doc4_US,NTF_Doc4_US,NTF,Horror,Positive,US,"There's an enlightening recent documentary, Horror Noire, which traces the history of black horror cinema through years of metaphorical monsters, gross stereotyping and degrading blacksploitation silliness, a history in which a black actor's character rarely survived past the halfway point of a horror movie and their lines were 50 percent the word ""damn"". Tellingly, the watershed moment Horror Noire uses to begin its narrative is from 2017's Get Out, Jordan Peele's debut film as writer and director, and one which won him an Oscar for best script - something few horror films have ever managed. The terror in the pictured scene, say the commentators - is that felt by a person of colour in a white, affluent, suburban neighbourhood, which is not something that had been captured on film before. Peele's long-awaited follow-up, Us, is no less revolutionary, but it is less explicit in its messaging. The political point here is simple: the protagonists in Us, the middle class family at the heart of the action, the lovable Winstons, are black. There's a shy boy, a confident girl, a goofy all-American dad (Winston Duke) and a mother with a secret (Lupita Nyong'o). They're not slasher fodder - they're the ones you're rooting for. It shouldn't be progressive, but it is. Us plays on the trope of the home invasion film, a modern horror staple that strikes to the very heart of the American psyche - Bad people! Horrible ones! In your property! Now! And your WiFi has gone down!!! But this is a Jordan Peele script, and therefore there is a twist: the people invading the family's home look exactly like the Winstons, but wearing red jumpsuits and carrying scissors. You can guess what they do with the scissors. As horror conceits go, it's a deeply creepy one - especially when Nyong'o's 'red' mother begins speaking, unleashing a pained, guttural, dusty drawl. Horror films can often be seen as a doss job for a Hollywood star - if ever there's a time to phone in a performance, it's there - but Nyong'o gives it the full Oscar-winner effort, shaping out two fully rounded characters: the mother and her evil alter-ego. As each member of the family must individually confront their own doppelganger, there are battles, there are jump scares and there are plenty of laughs too, which can often be an awkward balance to pull off in a horror film, but one which Jordan Peele excels at. In fact, there's plenty of satire here as the film scratches America's underbelly to find the shadows behind the American dream. The initial setting for the horror - Santa Cruz boardwalk - is somewhere that's meant to be fun, but every Lost Boys fan knows that it is, of course, full of damn vampires. There, a young Adelaide Wilson, played as an adult by Nyong'o, wins a Michael Jackson T-shirt, a symbol of the fallen hero. Music is used brilliantly too: '90s hip hop banger 'I Got Five On It' by Luniz appears"

On vacation in Adelaide 's hometown of Santa Cruz, site of an upsetting incident when she was a child, the young mom is tormented the past. Her attempts to squash the unhappy memories have been unsuccessful and now she is troubled by the fear that something bad will happen to her family if they don't pack up and head home.

Her worst nightmares come true when strange beings in red jumpsuits, carrying scissors, show up in their driveway. The really creepy part?

When the family first spies the mysterious family in the driveway Gabe puts on a brave face. ""Let's all stay calm,"" he says. But this isn't the kind of movie where people stay calm. Especially when feral shadow people with a grudge against anyone who grew up in the light are out for revenge. The Wilsons are a nice family confronted by something they could not imagine, let alone control. ""How many of anybody are there going to be,"" asks little Jason. Peele proves, as if there was any doubt, that ""Get Out"" was not a fluke. He skilfully navigates ""Us's"" story, establishing the Wilsons as a regular, likable family with a teen daughter prone to rolling her eyes and a father who's always quick with a dad joke. When the going gets grim Peele uses ingenuity, humour, a creepy kid choral score and some very scary images to add life to what might have been a simple home invasion movie.

Ridley Scott followed up his superb The Duellists - which won best first feature at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival - with seminal sci-fi hit Alien two years later, scoring a special effects Oscar for its chest-bursting menace. Quentin Tarantino topped Reservoir Dogs with Pulp Fiction. So I was pumped for Jordan Peele's much-hyped sophomore feature Us about a family menaced by stab-happy doppelgangers, after his exhilarating, Oscar-winning debut Get Out smartly rewired the horror genre, lancing rampant racism and creeping white privilege. Sadly his flash of brilliance totally fizzles this time. A genuinely unnerving set up in a 1986 fairground totally gets the creak of terror lurking in these places, with a wide-eyed Madison Curry as a young girl attacked by her evil double after being lost in a funhouse mirror hall. Positing another clever metaphor, with Americans as their own worst enemy, Peele soon loses focus. Jumping to the present, a goofy but overlong section sets up Black Panther duo Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke as a married couple taking a break in their wood-surrounded holiday cabin (never a good idea in horror films) with their kids, played by Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex. Taking too long to get there, Peele flubs an oddly inert home invasion when the family's maniacal scissor-wielding mirror images eventually show up. Basic jump scares abound, but there's no real terror. We do get a much more brutal attack on the neighbours, including The Handmaid's Tale's Elisabeth Moss, but a re-run is a re-run. The film's laborious pace is further hampered by Nyong'o's bad reflection setting out their terms in the worst asthmatic wheezing committed to film since Tom Hardy's much-memed Bane. Peele manages to bury the film in a turgid cement of tedious exposition while still leaving the basic world-building foundations decidedly wobbly. Get Out already joked about villains monologuing their dastardly plan. Pushing the same punchline here is just lazy. The patchy humour fares a bit better as the 'good' family gets increasingly violent in their fight back, but it's so on the nose it literally references Home Alone. Yeah, we got it. Pop culture call-outs galore, including an iconic line ripped from the Star Wars saga, only serve to highlight the dearth of new ideas here. With Peele borrowing liberally from better films like The Shining, it ends up feeling like a tired rehash. Speaking of which, I'm not going to die and be resurrected on a hill claiming the probably unnecessary Pet Sematary reboot is a masterpiece, but it at least has more fun re-animating Stephen King's zombie cat story with a zippier pace. Directed by Kevin Kolsch and Dennis Widmyer, the movie doesn't give Jason Clarke quite enough space to really work the crazed grief of a father tortured by a devastating accident, but there's just enough here to hurt. Tinkering with the tragic 1983 novel and the 1989 movie adaptation, it delivers a"
227,NTF_Doc7_US,NTF_Doc7_US,NTF,Horror,Negative,US,"Few directorial debuts were as shattering as Jordan Peele's Oscar-winning horror flick ""Get Out"" (2017), which not only won Best Original Screenplay, but should have won Best Picture (Rewriting Oscar History). It stands as a masterpiece of cultural significance and cinematic artistry, repaying on repeat viewings with enough double meanings to fill a film theory class. Thus, we get the eager anticipation and unrealistic expectations of ""Us,"" which again boasts powerful performances of tear-stained cheeks, stunning technical prowess with symbolic imagery and ""sunken place"" social satire. This time, however, its surface-level plot piles the ""gory"" on the allegory, straining its metaphors with logical inconsistencies beneath the twists. The story opens with Young Adelaide Wilson (Madison Curry) wandering off from her parents and suffering childhood trauma at a boardwalk fun house in Santa Cruz, California. Decades later, grown-up Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) and her husband Gabe (Winston Duke), take their kids, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex), on a return trip to Santa Cruz, but their family vacation turns chaotic when dangerous doppelgangers appear in their driveway. The dual personas provide a powerful stage for Nyong'o, who deserves Oscar consideration for Lead Actress six years after her Supporting Actress win for ""12 Years a Slave"" (2013). She essentially has to play two roles: one as a traumatized middle-class mother, one as a hoarse-throated shadow figure, but both with protective maternal instincts. You'll instantly recall Daniel Kaluuya's teacup hypnosis as Nyong'o keeps her eyes ""Peeled"" in bulging, teary terror. The same goes for Duke (""Black Panther""), who dons a Howard University sweatshirt and glasses to crack goofy dad jokes, then shifts to farsighted squints and primal moans as his shadow double. Most impressive are the child actors, as Joseph plays teenage innocence before shifting to a freaky frozen grin, and Alex playfully wears a plastic Halloween mask before shifting to his pyromaniac duplicate to wear a much creepier, canvas-style mask. Peele was inspired by the ""Mirror Image"" episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" (1960), which he is rebooting this spring. Cinephiles will also notice shades of Don Siegel's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1956), Michael Bay's ""The Island"" (2005) and Charlie McDowell's ""The One I Love"" (2014), which fittingly starred Elisabeth Moss (""Mad Men"") in a double role. She returns in ""Us"" with Tim Heidecker (""Tim & Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!"") as the wealthy parents of twins. Directing duplicates requires a carefully constructed dance of body doubles and over-the-shoulder trick shots - just ask Tatiana Maslany in BBC's ""Orphan Black"" (2013) and J.K. Simmons in Starz's ""Counterpart"" (2017). But it's worth the challenge, as it provides endless possibilities for dynamic direction. In ""Us,"" Peele presents Nyong'o's face pressed against her reflection in the cracking glass of a coffee table, a high-angle shot of the family on the beach with long shadows stretching across the sand, and the distorted images of funhouse mirrors. The latter-most is the most disturbing in a masterful opening boardwalk sequence, where Peele blends the whistling child danger"
228,NTF_Doc8_US,NTF_Doc8_US,NTF,Horror,Negative,US,"I was dying to see Jordan Peele's Us in theaters (no pun intended), but the timing never worked out. My husband and I loved Get Out, so we were both really looking forward to this movie. We had both heard mixed reviews, but the moment it was available to rent on digital, we rented it. Well, the reviews were mixed in our home too - with neither of us being able to say we loved it. The movie started great. I was sucked in (even though I had an idea where it was going). I was waiting for the ""bad guys"" to show up and the fighting to start. During this time, I was on the edge of my seat - I couldn't wait for the action to begin. And then about half way through is when US started to lose me. The tethers had arrived, and they were creepy at first. But when they started grunting at each other, they started to get annoying. The fact that only one of them could talk, got old very quickly. Both of us knew exactly what the big ""twist"" was going to be about 8 minutes in to the movie. It seemed so obvious. Toward the end, when a story is explained, I thought I was wrong for about a minute, and then I realized they were just trying to lead us astray. Had this twist not been as obvious to me, I might have liked this movie better. I sort of just started waiting for the big reveal. Wondering when it might happen. Which had me distracted throughout the second part of the film. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it. I just had much higher hopes. I scare easily - and I love it. My husband is always joking with me about how I jump at movies. How I cower under the blankets - with a big smile on my face the whole time. Some parts of this movie had me like this - but not many. I am usually the type that gets freaked out about weird things. For example, I was expecting to be worried that we all had tethers, because that is just what I do (I still think we might all be androids thanks to Westworld). But honestly, after watching about half of Us, I was not concerned anymore. Most of the tethers were insanely easy to kill - so they pose no real threat. If you know me, you know I love a good death scene. Perhaps I am a morbid person, but off the wall kills are some of my favorite scenes in films. I was hoping for more of that here, although some of them were super gory (and I loved it). There were some moments that made absolutely no sense to me. The main point of this movie is that everyone has a tether. Living under ground, and they are forced to do what you do. Except they don't get delicious food,"
229,NTF_Doc9_US,NTF_Doc9_US,NTF,Horror,Negative,US,"Following up on the kind of success Jordan Peele had with directorial debut ""Get Out"" was always going to be an anticipated event, hard to satisfy. ""Us"" will please the fans who discovered ""Get Out"" before it became a phenomenon and Oscar winner. What it won't do, is make the leap to awards contender or bring in audiences who typically stay far away from the horror movies. That doesn't mean it's a bad film, it's just different. Peele's newest work leans more into horror elements, aka producer Jason Blum's wheelhouse, and moves slightly away from Peele's comedic roots. Like its predecessor, ""Us"" has a message, but its underpinned by genre and action elements. Oscar winner Nyong'o (""12 Years a Slave"") is very good in the film, playing against everything in her filmography up to this point. The Wilson family has just arrived at their vacation home in Santa Cruz. Each time they visit, Adelaide (Nyong'o) gets anxious. Her husband Gabe (Duke) and the kids are excited to go down to the beach, but Adelaide struggles with trauma that occurred in her own childhood, near the same beach. After a successful start to their vacation, one evening Jason (Alex) the youngest, casually asks why there is a family standing in the driveway. Adelaide and Gabe first think it's a joke, but the situation turns dire when they realize not only is there a family standing in the dark on their property, but the four individuals look exactly like The Wilson family. ""It's us,"" Jason says when they all come face to face. It's survival of the fittest as terror breaks out on the quiet neighborhood and anything you can grab becomes a weapon. As far as home invasion movies go, ""Us"" works at getting the audience riled up, on edge and maintaining a level of suspense that will please those looking for Friday night thrills. While it doesn't solely depend on jump scares and other genre tropes, they are certainly part of the framework. However the length that Peele's script keeps the audience guessing is a bit too long. For those that came to ""Get Out"" after it reached a fever pitch, you expect more than just suspense, and you don't want to wait until the last ten minutes to get it. For much of the first and second half of the film, the audience is asked to go along with the thrill ride, without asking questions or being given enough pieces to complete the puzzle. However, those desensitized by the horror elements will be trying to guess the ending, and it becomes fairly obvious after only a few flashbacks. Tension is often broken by moments with the two young stars, Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex, who rise to the occasion of defending their family in a way that surprises the parents as much as it does the audience. If ""Get Out's"" brain surgery was the biggest sci-fi element for realists to swallow in that movie, ""Us"" raises the stakes."
230,NTF_Doc10_US,NTF_Doc10_US,NTF,Horror,Negative,US,"Us, Jordan Peele's follow up to his excellent Oscar-winning debut Get Out, is a go-for-broke ambitious mess of a film. I found myself thinking Peele's two films are akin to Ridley Scott's Alien and Prometheus; the former is a fresh, thematically-rich and chilling horror film with a simple-yet-terrifying premise (both Get Out and Alien are riffs on the haunted house trope) while the latter is just batshit crazy in the best possible way. It's as if Peele had a big brainstorming session with a smorgasbord of ideas, then decided to include every single one of them in Us. Us opens with a traumatic childhood event for Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o): in 1986, on the Santa Cruz beachfront, she wandered away from her parents for 15 minutes into an abandoned house of mirrors and saw a girl that looked exactly like her. Fast forward to a few decades later, and the adult Adelaide is headed to Santa Cruz again, this time with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and her two children, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex). A typical upper-class suburban family, they head to their beach house to relax and unwind. They meet up with their uppity wealthy friends, Kitty (Elisabeth Moss) and Josh (Tim Heidecker) and their twin teenage daughters, Becca and Lindsey (Cali and Noelle Sheldon). When Jason briefly disappears at the beach-coincidentally in the same carnival house of mirrors from Adelaide's past-and witnesses a strange figure standing with arms outstretched on the sand, it leaves Adelaide deeply unsettled. When darkness falls, Us turns into a home invasion film with a twist: the four red-jumpsuit-clad invaders standing out on the driveway are exact doppelgangers of the Wilson family. Let by the mother, Red (also played by Nyong'o), the new family's movements and demeanor are decidedly off and creepy; their stiff-yet-swift movements, unblinking stares, and deadly sharp golden scissors are all quite intimidating. When the two families are finally face to face, Gabe asks the question on everyone's mind: ""Who are you people?"" To which Red calmly responds: ""We're Americans."" Now, in my UK theatre, this line elicited a huge uproar of laughter. Indeed, Us is darkly hilarious, a genuine comedy as much as a horror film, and I laughed quite a bit throughout the final half. Though gruesomely violent at times, Us is not particularly scary, mostly due to the pacing and shot placement. Peele chooses to show us quite a bit of Red and her family (as well as other, future invaders), opting for an unsettled feeling rather than jump scares or outright dread and terror. If you simply accept its ridiculous premise and allow the jokes to set the tone, Us is quite a bit of wacky horrific fun. Metaphors work well when they're simple. This is not to say that there is a one-to-one correspondence of meaning, a This=That formula-true metaphors can elicit a polyvalence of legitimate interpretations and ideas-but rather that the symbol or sign doesn't require huge explantations to discern its"

Bliss? Is frisson somehow appropriate here? I guess it would all depend, largely, on how you feel about horror movies in the first place. But let's say you do. Like them, that is. In which case, a tricked-out number such as Sam Raimi's Drag Me To Hell, co-written by Raimi and his brother Ivan, will delight not just on the frenetic-fright level that Raimi set a certain bar for in his Evil Dead films of the '80s, but also for the ruthlessness with which it toys with viewer sympathies. To get into this a bit will require the use, alas, of some substantive spoilers. Which I will place, although perhaps not immediately, below the jump. Beware. Be warned. Raimi's Evil Dead films, beginning in 1981 with the just regular Evil Dead, an ultra-low budget DIY landmark, conflated hysterical laughter with hysterical screaming by making explicit the always-present link between horror violence and slapstick. Raimi's most obvious antecedents/inspirations were, of course, the Three Stooges, whose eye-gouging, strangulating, head-smiting antics would have caused grave if not fatal injuries if performed in earnest and in real life. Raimi upped the ante with gore, even more pronounced creepy/funny sound effects than you found in an average Stooges short, and a hyper moving camera style. Not to mention cutting that screamed ""Boo!"" over and over again at breakneck speed. The pictures established him as a gonzo horror maestro, but on entering Hollywood proper he applied his style to a number of different genres-the superhero movie (Darkman), the ""straight"" thriller (A Simple Plan) and even a baseball picture (For Love of the Game). His work on the blockbuster Spider Man films mostly subsumed his innovative side, alas, and that's one reason Drag Me To Hell's got fans of his earlier work excited. As well they should be. Ultra-extreme vomiting and swallowing are among the shock effects Raimi's added to the Dead bag of tricks, and they shift the horror action slightly away from Stooges territory and into the realm of great animation gagmen Tex Avery, Frank Tashlin, and Chuck Jones. Indeed, there's a bit involving an anvil hanging from the ceiling of a toolshed that could have come straight out of a Road Runner cartoon-and the bug-eyed reaction when the anvil drops is the live-action equivalent of one of the escaped-con-wolf's double takes upon finding he's still got Droopy on his tail in Northwest Hounded Police. But while the Evil Dead pictures kind of prided themselves on their thoroughly one-dimensional characterizations-there was the stolid and rather somewhat stupid square-jawed hero Ash, surrounded by malevolent demons and not much else, at least until 1992's Army of Darkness, in which he teamed up with a bunch of medieval clods-here Raimi goes for...well, I wouldn't call it depth, exactly.

""Drag Me To Hell"" delivers on modern genre expectations even if it doesn't quiet exceed them to become a true horror classic. With tighter editing, a stronger lead, and a few more surprising twists in the screenplay, ""Drag Me To Hell"" could have been something truly remarkable, although, with the state of the horror genre, just being as good as it is will be more than enough for most fans. Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is about to learn that life often has more than a glass ceiling. Sometimes it has a blazing floor. Playing off the themes of misogyny so rampant in all horror, ""Drag Me To Hell"" presents a heroine just trying to get ahead at work, put her dark past behind her, and impress her new boyfriend's parents. Of course, we all know how well that's going to turn out. With a promotion looming, Christine is instructed by her boss (David Paymer) that she needs to prove that she can make the tough decisions required of management. An elderly woman named Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) comes to her looking for one more loan extension on her mortgage and Christine sees the opportunity to impress her boss. She refuses the wrong client and ends up on the wrong end of a Lamia curse. After a trip to a seer named Rham Jas (Dileep Rao), Christine learns that she has three days to reverse the curse or be literally dragged to Hell. During that period, Christine is what you could call ""prepped"" for her upcoming journey. She hears sounds that her boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) does not, blood gushes from her nose, and she sees dangerous shadows that like to toss her around the apartment. The question becomes whether or not Christine can do anything to stop her trip to Hell. Can any of us? How far is Christine willing to go to stop her damnation? Is there any length you would not go to if it meant your soul's redemption? You can nearly picture writers Ivan Raimi & Sam Raimi gleefully setting up each twist and turn in the entire project and laughing the entire time. ""Drag Me To Hell"" is designed to provoke responses and the laughing, screaming, jumping crowd I saw it with serve as evidence that it works. The glimpses of ""Evil Dead"" horror-comedy brilliance come through in a few key sequences that more than justify the ticket price including a fantastic seance-gone-wrong with a possessed goat, a parking garage battle of the gross, and a nearly-slapstick fight with a killer hankie that brings back memories of ""Ash versus his own hand"" in ""Dead by Dawn"".

233,KTT_Doc3_DragMetoHell,KTT_Doc3_DragMetoHell,KTT,Horror,Positive,Drag Me to Hell,"""The Evil Dead was one of the primary altars at which I prayed as a young student of the cinematic arts--a vital entry in that education for how it left me shocked, nay, stupefied that such a work could actually exist, with its twitching limbs and tree-rapes and fountains of oatmeal ichor. How did they get away with that stuff? So it goes, I think, with Sam Raimi's best efforts, these four-colour horror comics put on film, blindsiding you with their towering insanity before you can understand just how deeply they'll worm into your psyche with their sadness and panic. Sounds incredibly petty to say, but I have to admit that when he found mainstream success and acceptance with the Spider-Man franchise, a little piece of that anarchic spirit died for me. Raimi himself was transparently nostalgic for it in Spider-Man 3, a decidedly misguided attempt to hark back to the themes of his original superhero masterpiece, Darkman. Dusting off an old horror script Raimi wrote with brother Ivan, Drag Me to Hell is best described as an ebullient hybrid of his big-budget and no-budget sensibilities. His chintzy use of CGI finally locates its footing in recreations of the popped eyeballs and demonic animals of Evil Dead II; and when a possessed man floats five feet in the air to dance around like a marionette, it feels like a homecoming. (Not to mention that we get a better look at Raimi's beloved '73 Delta 88--thrown back into its role as a harbinger of doom--than we have in years.) That constant twinge of familiarity in meeting fanboy expectations may also be Drag Me to Hell's most glaring flaw, but why be so cynical as to begrudge Raimi the kind of manic set-pieces he's had to forgo over the past fifteen years? When an honest-to-God anvil is utilized in the only way you'd expect it to be utilized by a man raised on Looney Tunes and the Three Stooges, you realize that, goddamnit, the old boy's still got it. Eager to make the ""tough decisions"" that will land her an assistant manager's position, bank loan officer Christine (Alison Lohman) unwisely denies an elderly gypsy witch (Lorna Raver) an extension on her mortgage payments, whereupon the gypsy curses her to suffer an eternity in Hell. But before that, Christine must undergo three days' worth of supernatural tortures involving nosebleeds that grow into geysers, wanton corpse abuse, and dead crones vomiting maggots and formaldehyde on the hapless faces of the living. Crowd-pleasing gross-outs of the highest order, no doubt, but Drag Me to Hell may be the first film that actively pinpoints Raimi's explosion of bodily fluids as an acute uneasiness with mortality. The movie establishes itself as something delightfully over-the-top very early on--I don't think there's ever been anything more hilarious/horrifying than the battle royale with the old lady, which culminates in the very real threat of being gummed to death. Add to that the fact that the now-svelte Christine once tipped the"

Drag Me to Hell presents the spectacle of a banker being cursed, half-strangled, vomited upon, pinged around a room like a Lotto ball, surprised by an eyeball in a slice of cake, threatened with eternal hellfire and - poetic justice here - ripped off by a pawnbroker. Audiences may find it difficult at times to suppress a cheer. Or a nervous belly laugh, come to that, because its moments of Grand Guignol, repulsive and obscene as they are, also give the funny bone a good tweak. Yet the grotesque punishment meted out to the banker hasn't quite the cathartic frisson you might expect. For one thing, Christine Brown is only a humble loans officer at a bank, where her manager has warned her that she'll only clinch that promotion if she shows herself capable of making ""tough decisions"". For another, she is played by Alison Lohman, whose sweetly innocent face make her look as if she might have Hannah Montana posters on her bedroom wall (she's actually 30 this year). In any case, that tough decision comes her way when a witchy looking crone with one eye and fingernails of nicotine brown stops by her desk to ask for an extension on her mortgage payments. Her name is Mrs Ganush, but she might as well be called Mrs Lugosi, such is her terrifying mittel-European strangeness. Christine, mindful of the promotion, refuses her request, then looks mortified when the old woman gets down on her knees to beg. It all ends rather unpleasantly when Christine has to call security and the outraged client, her home lost to foreclosure, is ejected. But the word ""unpleasant"" doesn't cover what happens next: Christine is attacked in her car by the vengeful Mrs Ganush, a scene that brings out all of Raimi's inventive grotesquerie. Who else would think of an old biddy losing her dentures as she moves in to bite her foe, and ends up slobbering over Christine's face with her toothless maw. In a word: ugh. The upshot of this savage tussle is Mrs Ganush tearing off a button from Christine's coat and calling down a Gypsy curse that will see her dragged to hell by an avenging demon named the Lamia. Don't you just hate it when that happens? With swift despatch, Christine starts to suffer the kind of unearthly ordeal that Raimi last visited on Bruce Campbell in his Evil Dead movies. A nosebleed at work turns into a veritable spray-painting of her office and (doh!) her boss (""Did any of it get in my mouth?"" he bleats).

So if you're a member of the hardcore Raimi elite, rest assured that this is the film you've been waiting nearly a decade for. But despite its wild entertainment value, the film also begs a few important, if somewhat controversial, questions. At what point in a celebrated director's career do audiences simply become too forgiving? Is having a particular cinematic style or point-of-view, no matter how dynamic, sufficient to excuse a few notable shortcomings? And does it matter how something makes you scream or laugh, so much as that it made you react at all? But before we tackle some of the bigger issues associated with Drag Me to Hell, we should say from the outset that this film is absolute, undiluted Raimi -- his love-letter to those fans who've waited patiently for a departure from the mainstream and a return to his kinetic, tongue-through-cheek brand of horror-comedy. The film is simultaneously loud, fast, brutal, hilarious, disgusting, dark and whimsical, combining legitimate scares with gruesome, almost slapstick gags to great and bloody effect. Drag Me to Hell is, without a doubt, the kind of film where, if you're pre-disposed to love it, you absolutely will. For those less familiar with the film, Drag Me to Hell is the story of a young woman named Christine (Alison Lohman), who in an effort to get promoted at the bank where she works denies the pleas of an old gypsy woman (Lorna Raver) to extend the loan on her family home. After a violent, and distinctly Raimi-esque, attack in the bank's garage later that evening, the gypsy places a curse on Christine, calling down the demonic Lamia to plague her for three terrifying days before finally coming to drag Christine, quite literally, to Hell. This is explained to Christine by a palm-reader at the objection of Christine's more level-headed boyfriend, Clay Dalton (Justin Long). The remainder of the film focuses on Christine's efforts to dispel the curse whatever the physical or moral costs. And part of the film's brilliance is found in its play on the common horror heroine. Where most films begin with either some sinful character who'll no doubt find their eventual punishment or a virginal protagonist who will fight, and ultimately survive, through some terrifying experience, Raimi's Christine proves something of the opposite, beginning the film as an innocent victim who, through her attempts at saving herself, commits acts that make her increasingly more deserving of the fate to which she's been condemned. Make no mistake, Drag Me to Hell is out to scare you. This is clearly one of the loudest horror films we've seen in the last few years, using volume and quick, sudden editing to illicit jump scares with a rather overwhelming frequency.

Sure, it's fun that Raimi took a break from counting his Spider-Man loot to bang out a quickie slasher strongly reminiscent of his Evil Dead beginnings. But couldn't Drag Me to Hell, which Raimi co-wrote with his bro Ivan, have been just a little bit more imaginative? Apart from the evocative title, which is a great nod to '50s drive-in fare, the film is as predictable as a meal beneath the golden arches. Demonic possession unleashed by strange incantation? Check. Buckets of gore and various flavours of vomit? Check. 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 gratuitously used as prop? Check. Plot written on back of postcard? Check and double check. In many ways it's Evil Dead 4, which may explain the critical huzzahs from Cannes to California, with a gender flip for minor variety. This time, the dead-dodging protagonist is a woman, rather than the hapless hero played so memorably and hilariously by Raimi regular Bruce Campbell. Pity that the woman is Alison Lohman, a woeful actress who seems to have been chosen solely for her resemblance to Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst (Raimi is one freaky cat). As much as I enjoy the thought of Lohman being dragged to hell - I hold her responsible for the failure of Atom Egoyan's Where the Truth Lies - she's as exciting to watch as a sack of hammers. Her character Christine is just too dumb and innocent to warrant the supernatural abuse dealt out to her after she unwittingly runs afoul of a vengeful gypsy crone named Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver). Eager to prove to her grasping bank boss (David Paymer) that she has the cojones to dodge bad loans, Christine's bad timing has her turning down a mortgage extension for Mrs. Ganush when the old hag comes begging. For acting like a bureaucrat rather than a saint, Christine's punishment is to spend the next 90 minutes attempting to dodge the curse of the Lamia, a body-snatching entity from hell that holds big-time grudges and won't take ""no"" for an answer. Not even the blood sacrifice suggested by a street-corner swami (Dileep Rao) appeases the grabby ghouls. (Note to cat lovers: be ready to gaze downward into popcorn bag.) One might argue Christine is already facing perpetual damnation by agreeing to marry her drippy boyfriend Clay (Justin Long), who takes forever to figure things out. Having Lohman and Long co-starring in the same movie is like being banished to the cinema circle of Dante's Inferno. Part of the problem with Drag Me to Hell is that it's not 1981 anymore, the year The Evil Dead rebooted the horror genre. Special effects have gotten a whole lot less special in the intervening decades. Raimi used to have to use ingenuity to get his lo-fi shocks; now he just has to flip a computer switch.

Perhaps, then, it shouldn't be routinely dismissed as just another tale of demons and ghosts that has been emasculated with the goal of appealing to pimple-faced teenagers who haven't figured out how to sneak into legitimate R-rated features. Raimi, despite having become sidetracked by a certain web-slinging superhero in recent years, has legitimate horror credentials. Not only is his Evil Dead trilogy considered a horror milestone, but he's the only director to have gotten Katie Holmes to doff her top. That alone has to count for something although, had The Gift been rated PG-13, Katie's assets would have remained concealed. So has Raimi achieved the Holy Grail? Has he made a horror film that chills and thrills yet is mild enough to allow admittance to comers of all ages? Sadly, no. But wait... all is not lost. Although Drag Me to Hell mostly fails as horror, it achieves sporadic success as a comedy. The conundrum lies in locating the line of demarcation between intentional and unintentional humor. With Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness, Raimi demonstrated that he enjoys spiking his blood and gore with satire, wit, and the Three Stooges. Some of that is in evidence here. Unfortunately, there are also times when the direction and acting are so ham-fisted that intended scares provoke chortles instead of gasps. Even if one shifts mindset and looks at Drag Me to Hell as pure satire, its effectiveness is middling. It feels bloated and overlong and the occasional bursts of laughter don't warrant a 100-minute investment of time. Loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is vying with a co-worker for the vacant position of assistant manager. She needs the promotion not only to secure her future but to impress the parents of her boyfriend, Clay (Justin Long), who think she's not good enough for their son. The bank manager, Mr. Jacks (David Paymer), delights in playing Christine against her rival and watching the sparks fly. One day, a crone with the improbable name of Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) comes to the bank asking for relief from a mortgage she can't pay. She's behind on her payments and is about to lose her house. Mr. Jacks leaves the resolution of the matter to Christine and she decides to take the hard-line to demonstrate her toughness. Mrs. Ganush does not react well to this. A verbal confrontation leads to a physical alteration which culminates in the old woman leveling a curse at Christine's jacket button. Soon thereafter, Christine begins having disturbing visitations by things that go bump in the night, and she solicits the aid of a mystic (Dileep Rao) to rid her of the curse and its associated devil who, after three days of haunting her, will claim her soul and drag her bodily to hell. Before that, she has a conversation with a talking goat and a life-and-death struggle with a psychotic handkerchief. If one wants"

At the very least, it should inspire a banquet of dread or offer a canape of anxiety. After Drag Me to Hell you won't mind walking home alone. You might even welcome a dark, deserted alley. It could help alleviate the anger of knowing you've been had. This is surprising, since Drag Me to Hell is the creation of writer-director Sam Raimi, whose body of work has been dedicated to turning more than one viewer's hair white with the Evil Dead and Spider-Man franchises. The only thing he's likely to turn a viewer to this time is the door marked exit. For God only knows what reason, it begins with a prelude staged in 1969 in Pasadena. A kid steals a necklace from a gypsy wagon and takes refuge in one of those old houses that look like W. C. Fields lived there. The doors slam open; people fall to their deaths; the floor opens and sucks the little thief into a cauldron of flames; and the house goes back to looking like a silent-film set. Forty years later, a pretty loan officer in a California bank named Christine Brown (Alison Lohman, sometimes unfairly confused with Lindsay Lohan) refuses to extend a delinquent loan to an ancient hag with one eye and a mouth full of black incisors who has an epileptic fit in the middle of the bank and puts a curse on the young career girl. The nightmare begins. The crone attacks her in the underground parking garage, wrecks her car and rips a button from her coat. Soon she hears the same voices the little boy heard back in 1969. A bug crawls into her nose in the middle of the night. The next day at work she spews blood all over the bank. Her boyfriend (Justin Long) pooh-poohs the whole thing, until she bakes a harvest cake to impress his snobby parents and a human eye pops out of the batter with the kind of ensuing dinner-table chaos that guarantees a short engagement with no need for the bridal registry at Bloomingdale's. Seeking the help of a loopy carnival medium, Christine finds herself up to her pierced ears in corpse vomit, animal sacrifice, violent seances and open graves. Nothing stops the curse. The road to deliverance leads to the same old house in Pasadena containing the doorway to hell, but the movie doesn't end there. There's still a preposterous finale in a grotesque cemetery that tickles the funny bone more than it assaults the nervous system. Sound effects play an important part in the superficial mechanics (pots and pans rattle, glass shatters, powerful forces knock people to the floor), and to Mr. Raimi's credit, there is no happy ending. Still, the first rule in spook films is ""If you want to hold the audience's attention, make them believe the horror could really happen""-a rule Drag Me to Hell ignores at its"

As with his three Evil Dead films, Drag Me To Hell straddles the gap between Horror and Comedy by combining elements of slapstick knockabout humour with the major keys, creeping camera-work and build and release mechanics of the Horror genre. However, for a film that seeks to trade so heavily upon its big visual set-pieces, it is not only poorly written but grossly over-written too. Christine (Alison Lohman) is a former rural beauty queen who has moved to the big city. Insecure about herself and her status she spends her nights terrified by the thought of her rich boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) not approving of her, and her days locked in a life-and-death struggle for an assistant manager's post with a guy who just joined the company (Reggie Lee). In the hope of securing herself a promotion, she turns down an old Roma lady's (Lorna Raver) attempt at re-mortgaging her house, resulting in her losing her home. Humiliated, Mrs. Ganush retaliates by sending a demon after the loan officer that will torment her for days before dragging her off to hell. In an attempt to save herself, Christine enlists an Asian psychic named Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) despite the protestations of her sceptical boyfriend. What most struck me as I sat watching Drag Me To Hell is its quite overt racism. The film's depiction of the Roma people is straight out of the darkest dreams of the Daily Mail and a tradition of racial prejudice, fear and scape-goating that stretches back at least as far as the Dark Ages. Mrs. Ganush is physically disgusting, replete with disease and foul habits. A vindictive and dishonest creature who needs little provocation before lashing out at honest white middle class people using her sinister gypsy powers. Her family are presented in a similar tone as a pack of ugly, sinister and unsympathetic people playing weird violin music in the basement of a tumbledown old house. I would have some sympathy for the idea that the Raimi brothers - as Americans - have little awareness of the spectre of genocide that still hangs over the European treatment and depiction of gypsiesexcept that, even accepting that this kind of gross ignorance is acceptable, it does not explain why the same kind of racially-inspired, type-based characterisation also applies to other non-White characters. Drag Me To Hell also features the 'seer' Rham Jas and the Latina medium Shaun San Dena (Adriana Barraza). Both of these characters are non-white. Both of these characters are 'closer to the Earth' and possessed of magical powers that they to help the white protagonist. Both characters are, quite clearly, variations on the theme of the Magical Negro; a racist throwback to the idea that non-White people are somehow Other and different to White people. Other Magical Negroes include, most famously, Uncle Remus from Song of the South (1946) but also much"

A young woman aspiring for big professional opportunities at a bank makes a grievous error with a mysterious woman who arrives at her desk pleading for help, resulting in a horrific curse that anchors the crosshairs of torment onto her soul for a resulting 100 minutes of loud and foreboding celluloid. Her house thumps with the thundering sounds of something monstrous, and then a shadowy form tosses her around like a torn rag doll. She is attacked in her office garage. Animals hiss and growl as she walks by. She is assailed by visions of a malevolent being who makes clear his purpose of pulling her into an afterlife of endless torture and suffering. And then the movie demands the panic-stricken victim to sacrifice a kitten in a vain attempt to ward off the evil presence... and in that moment, a deplorable line is crossed. For the remaining running time, no more is it our concern as to whether she is going to emerge from the experience in tact or unscathed; the real hell eluded to by said title now becomes the movie theater, where moviegoers go from being surprised and thrilled to completely appalled by some contemptible plot decisions. After a certain point, the movie becomes our own cinematic damnation from which there is no escape. The movie is the brain child of Sam Raimi, who was made famous in this genre early on with the ""Evil Dead"" series, and then departed the trenches of B-movie horror comedy in favor of loftier Hollywood ambitions. The results were eclectic but effective, yielding the marvelous ""A Simple Plan,"" a taut thriller called ""The Gift,"" and the box office triumph of the first three ""Spider Man"" movies. Somehow, after those achievements, Raimi's mind convinced itself that revisiting the past was a wise decision, perhaps strengthened by the noting that more money for a film budget was as his disposal, and the support of a major studio would give him certain freedoms with this approach that were not allotted to him so many years prior. Sometimes, they say, the past is better left there. The movie stars Alison Lohman as Christine Brown, the would-be heroin of the story, who is basically a collection of insecurities masquerading around under the veneer of opportunistic intentions. She is a financial consultant at a bank, vying for an assistant manager position and doing nearly anything possible to try and impress her indecisive boss, who is also considering a potentially more qualified candidate for the job. Those lofty ambitions are realized when an old and grotesque woman (Lorna Raver) comes to her desk, begging for a third extension on her house's mortgage. Christine feigns sympathy, but denies the claim and leaves her at the mercy of a foreclosure. The old woman begins causing a public scene by getting on her knees, to which Christine calls security"

You could even call it a meat market-sure, it's a cliched phrase, but what cliche isn't rooted in some truth? In debuting director Mimi Cave's entertaining and bonkers satirical horror ""Fresh,"" Noa knows all about the losers on the bland menu of her endless app scrolls-it's understandable that she has lost her taste for kissing the frogs. Still, our modern West Coaster-charismatically played by ""Normal People"" breakout Daisy Edgar-Jones-refuses to give up optimism and puts herself out there courageously, scarf-wearing douche-y dudes be damned! It's through her sweet hopefulness that she passes on countless faux-cool profile photos during one such evening of mindless browsing, and reaches out to someone sporting a cute dog picture as his avatar. But what thanks does she get for her curiosity? Nothing, just a gross dick picture sent by your average creeper. We get introduced to Noa in a pitch-perfect opening scene during a horrendous date with one of those aforesaid scarf-wearers. A cheapskate (""Bring cash,"" he reminds Noa before the date even takes place), Chad chews his noodles while spewing all sorts of stomach-churning vitriol. ""You would look great in a dress,"" he rudely tells the sweater-donned Noa, putting her down for not being into femininity ""like the women of his parents' generation."" He insults their waitress with blatant racism. He feels entitled enough to grab all the leftovers, not hold the door for Noa (What happened to all that ""parents' generation"" talk?) and calls her a stuck-up bitch when his reach for a kiss doesn't get reciprocated. So can you really blame Noa for rapidly buying into the grand gestures of Sebastian Stan's traditional charmer Steve on the heels of this disastrous evening and falling to bed with him? You can't-hey, it's the ever-appealing Stan we're talking about-but you are allowed to raise a slight eyebrow when this practical woman completely trusts a perfect stranger she only just met at a supermarket aisle, by allowing him to whisk her away to a surprise weekend getaway to an unknown location. Thankfully, her droll, bisexual best-friend Mollie (a terrific Jojo T. Gibbs) who seems to have given up on men completely, has much sharper instincts. No social media footprint? Not even an Instagram page as someone who claims to be a plastic surgeon? To Mollie, these are all red flags. They will seem shady enough to the viewers too, thanks to Lauryn Kahn's zippy script and Cave's visual language that, in unison, suggest enough of an unease beneath Steve's casual allure. To the careful ear, ""I don't eat animals"" from his lips will ring one or two alarm bells. (Why not just say, ""I'm a vegetarian?"") Other clues will hint shades of this mystery man's unusual tastebuds, too. But it's not until the title card ""Fresh"" appears more than 30 minutes into the film that they will be spelled out for all their grotesqueness."
242,AWM_Doc2_Fresh,AWM_Doc2_Fresh,AWM,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"There's a specific cruelty to modern dating, a seemingly unending grind of gut-punching disappointment and hurt, something that's easily judged and lampooned by those no longer in the game but something that's really only understood by those still playing. In first-time director Mimi Cave's rattling debut Fresh, Noa (Normal People's Daisy Edgar-Jones) is exhausted. In a believably odious first scene first date, she's informed by her indoor scarf-wearing match that women are no longer as feminine as they should be, in all these comfy over-sized clothes, as he monologues to her about his passion for hot sauce. She leaves with a familiar eye-roll (he calls her a stuck-up bitch, natch) forced back to swiping for love but instead, being met with more unsolicited dick pics. It's enough to make even the most romantic of romantics admit defeat. When she meets Steve (Sebastian Stan) in the fresh produce aisle of the local supermarket, she's caught off-guard by his charm, a handsome, keen and emotionally available stranger who talks as much as he listens. They begin dating and while her best friend Molly (Jojo T Gibbs) is alarmed by his lack of social media presence - a red flag in the 2020s, surely? - Noa allows herself to slowly believe that maybe she's finally getting what she deserves. Steve surprises her with a weekend away but first, with traffic shifting their journey to morning, she'll get to see his place for the first time. Remote and expansive (""This is intimidating,"" she remarks), she can't believe her luck. But after a few sips of an old-fashioned, Noa starts to feel woozy. Before she has time to process, it's lights out and that's just the first in a series of nasty surprises. The believable meet-cute first act takes place entirely, audaciously, before the opening credits, a sweet 30-minute romcom that quickly switches up to reveal something sour, like biting into a succulent peach that's rotten on the inside. It would be a spoiler, I believe, to detail exactly what the big reveal is although Cave gives us ample warning signs: the title, the location of the initial meet, the references to food ... the general nature of it isn't a surprise but the specifics are, a bracingly nasty rug-pull detailed with chilling normality. While Fresh can be easily filed a part of the boom in ""social thrillers"", exploding post the extraordinary success of Jordan Peele's Oscar-winning Get Out, it's one of the few that manages to grip us without the use of a heavy hand. What screenwriter Lauryn Kahn and Cave realise is that first and foremost, this is a genre movie, and rather than waste time patting themselves on the back for making clumsy ""but this is really about"" commentary, they're too busy trying to make our palms sweat and our pulses race. While some of the plot details might skirt close to B-movie absurdity, Fresh exists in a real world with real people, rules and stakes. So when terrible things happen, we're"
243,AWM_Doc3_Fresh,AWM_Doc3_Fresh,AWM,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"About thirty minutes into ""Fresh,"" a deliciously jangly horror movie, the opening credits roll. Up until then, the movie, which premiered in the Midnight section of the Sundance Film Festival, unfolds like an edgy romantic comedy. In the opening scene, Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones, with a bite) shows up for an app date, which turns out to be a dud: A vain cheapskate who's brusque with the waiter, the guy tells Noa between bites of their meal that her sweater looks shlumpy and a dress would suit her better. Reading the disagreeable signs, Noa bids him a polite goodbye, but not before Mr. Conceited Civility, upon rejection, can shout, ""Good luck finding a guy, you stuck up bitch."" This sort of bait-and-switch becomes a key ingredient in ""Fresh,"" Mimi Cave's classy and clever feature directorial debut. Written by Lauryn Kahn, the movie is framed as a parable of the anxieties of modern dating, of how truly impossible it can feel for (straight) women to catch a break. It's a familiar setup, and one that's vulnerable to the traps of heavy-handedness and cliche. But unlike recent predecessors - ""Promising Young Woman"" and the short story ""Cat Person"" come to mind - ""Fresh"" doesn't wholly aspire to be a feminist arrow to the heart of today's heterosexual dating scene. More so, it uses its central idea as fodder for stylish black comedy. Where ""Promising Young Women"" tended to feel labored and clumsy, ""Fresh"" is sleek and nimble, a worthy new entry into the feminist revenge thriller genre. Many of the movie's comic pleasures are thanks to Sebastian Stan, who, invitingly clean-cut and bashful, plays a Texan surgeon named Steve whom Noa meets and exchanges endearing conversation with in an unlikely place: the produce aisle of the grocery store. ""I didn't think people met people in real life anymore,"" Noa marvels later, gushing about the meet-cute to her best friend, Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs). Even so, early dates with Steve go well, and Noa grows cautiously excited. When her new paramour asks for a weekend getaway together, Noa graciously accepts. Has she finally struck gold? It's here that we reach the opening credits, and the movie spins into nail-biting suspense and terror. At this point in the movie, Mollie seems to be getting the short end of the stick. Noa's best (and seemingly only) friend, Mollie is Black and queer, a token sidekick character whose personal life, job, and dating prospects we learn almost nothing about - though we do know that she's prone to too-loudly encouraging Noa to ""get that D."" But as the story continues, and Steve - no surprise here - turns out not to be the sweet guy he promised, both Mollie and Noa's characters are given space to deepen. Edgar-Jones, who most notably played Marianne on Hulu's ""Normal People,"" is an absorbing screen presence, taking a role that could've been played as dopey - the romance cynic who falls for the gentleman - and injecting it with a quiet"
244,AWM_Doc4_Fresh,AWM_Doc4_Fresh,AWM,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"Much has been said when it comes to the realm of modern dating. Romance is dead, love is manufactured, people put on a persona. Many long for the ""old days"" of bumping into someone at a bar or a party or, in Noa's case, at the grocery store. Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is your average young person trying to navigate the dating scene today. Between swiping right on Chads who comment on how she should try wearing dresses to accepting that living life alone might be a better alternative, finding love is a struggle. Enter Steve (Sebastian Stan). Charming, funny, and undeniably hot, he seems to be the perfect package. Not only is he an impressive plastic surgeon, but he's not tied to social media and seems to be totally okay meeting someone the old-fashioned way. The two bump into each other at the produce aisle of a grocery store, and the rest is, as they say, history. Post-meet-cute, they go on a date before tumbling into bed for a hook-up. Soon, he's whisking her off to a cabin in the woods for a getaway that seems like the perfect ending to a rom-com. Except, while Fresh has both romance and comedy elements, it is most firmly placed in the horror category, and it takes a very sharp turn for our hero, Noa. What seems to be the perfect courtship is turning into the relationship of nightmares. In a story about control, domination, and consumption, director Mimi Cave offers up an exciting new twist on a familiar story. There are many elements of Fresh that hardly fit its namesake. The trope of charming guy turned twisted killer is a tale as old as time, and any true-crime aficionado knows there is truth to the fiction. The take on the exhaustion of modern romance is similarly familiar ground; most sitcoms and dramedies today have something to say about the perils and annoyances of Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble. Even Steve's true motives and proclivities have been infamously explored in horror, though the reveal is quite surprising. However, Cave takes these familiar elements and mishmashes them together in a way that feels...fresh. The camera is kinetic as it follows a roguish but somewhat manic Steve around, swinging to-and-fro. It snaps back and forth between events happening in the present and those in the near future. It is rarely overt or obtrusive, but when Cave wants you to know that she's making a statement, she states it out loud. This direction is bolstered by Lauryn Kahn's witty script. The humor is filled with puns but not in a dad-at-a-barbecue kind of way, it's extremely dark, and yet you can't help but spare her a chuckle. Noa and Steve are funny together, and although Steve is clearly a psychopath, Stan is insanely enjoyable to watch. He really relishes every line once the mask comes off, and he's able to embrace who he really is in front of Noa. Edgar-Jones is impressive, and as the stakes get"

""Fresh,"" the debut feature from longtime music video director Mimi Cave, knows this and plays with genre in a way that is devilish and delightful - and never from a place of posturing. Daisy Edgar-Jones stars as Noa, a woman who has seen the highs and lows (particularly the lows) of dating, from unsolicited pics of guys' genitalia to indoor-scarf-wearing Chads. When she serendipitously meets the sincere and charming Steve (Sebastian Stan) - in the produce aisle of a grocery store, of all places - things seem almost too good to be true, with her best friend, Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs), dubiously remarking, ""It's a straight girl's fantasy come true!"" While the film's first 30 minutes set up the modern horrors of dating for the 30-something set and the expected redemptive narrative arc, ""Fresh"" upends itself (and its audience) with a sudden tonal shift that resolutely punctures the story world we knew, setting into motion instead a horror film that confidently refreshes generic conventions. With a sharply energetic script from comedy screenwriter Lauryn Kahn, ""Fresh"" willfully borrows from both comedy and horror in a way that destabilizes the use of each. It flirts not only with total disruption of audience expectation, but also with the boundaries of obscenity as it lands beat after beat of light-on-its-feet humor within a story world that is in all ways macabre. As too does its visual style, which is just as playful, amorphous and intentional as its script. While both stylish and mischievous, it also knows when to pull back, allowing for moments of vulnerability and a chance to sit with Steve's horrific nature. In comparison to a film like ""I, Tonya"" (coincidentally another Stan vehicle), ""Fresh,"" despite its consistent boundary-pushing, knows how to use its visual style and tone effectively. Here, violence against women is not reveled in, or embellished by an all-too-gleeful cinematography, but rather it rejects certain forms of visual spectacle (while leaning wholeheartedly into others) in a way that stands with, even cheers for, its women characters. While we are absolutely witness to the gruesome and grotesque here - this is certainly not a film for the faint of heart - ""Fresh"" knows exactly when and when not to push into its own lurid nature. As the film's final act ramps up, it is aware that its own stakes are too high not to invest full-heartedly in its final girls. Just as the film knows we are able to delight in the comic heights of Stan's fantastically rendered Steve, it recognizes that we would take even more pleasure in the downfall of such a despicable man. ""Fresh,"" without a doubt, has a bounty of vision and personality, but it's also a wonderful study in an almost rabid compartmentalization in terms of its story world, its characters and its viewers.

You'd be forgiven for assuming that a movie co-starring Daisy Edgar-Jones (the star of the sex-scene heavy ""Normal People"") and Sebastian Stan (a man who doesn't own a shirt) would be a hot-blooded romance. But ""Fresh,"" which premiered in the ""Midnight"" section of the Sundance Film Festival Thursday and hits Hulu March 4, will more likely make you hurl than send you racing for a cold shower. The title doesn't describe the movie very well. ""Fresh"" is a familiar and somewhat successful horror film in the socially conscious mold of ""Get Out."" There are shocks and suspense. When the twist - which will not be revealed here - arrived, I let out a loud expletive. That's the most thrilling (and disgusting) moment of the director Mimi Cave's movie. A couple scenes after made me almost lose my lunch. And then the next hour comes off like a cool-down exercise. Noah (Edgar-Jones) is a typical twenty-something who hates modern dating, and the way carefully crafted Tinder profiles can obscure that somebody is actually a jackass or a perv. So, imagine her happy surprise when an attractive man named Steve (Stan) chats her up in the supermarket produce aisle. Soon they're on a date at a restaurant and making small talk. ""Where are you from?,"" he asks. ""The East Coast,"" she replies. There are many such annoyingly vague exchanges in Lauryn Kahn's script. Noah is cagey, fine, but it is wholly unbelievable that Steve wouldn't ask a follow-up question - ""Wherein?"" - considering that the East Coast includes both Savannah and Manhattan. She also says she has no siblings, her dad is dead and she doesn't know where her mom is. After only two dates, Steve wants to take this totally unattached woman on a weekend trip to a surprise location. There are more red flags here than the Soviet Union. The pair hops in the car, and in the case of Noah, would be better off driving over a cliff. Her experience is excruciating, and I suspect that some viewers - lured in by an outwardly appealing horror flick on Hulu - will turn it off once they discover what this freak is really up to. The movie shares a director of photography, Pawel Pogorzelski, with ""Hereditary"" and ""Midsommar."" His sense of style and foreboding color palate is here, only put to use in a much less artful film. Edgar-Jones, I'm happy to report, is just as vulnerable and witty when handed a campy thriller with sub-par writing as she is on the sublime miniseries ""Normal People,"" which netted her a Golden Globe nomination in 2021. Even at her worst-off, we believe she's capable of changing her situation. And Stan gets to give his charm a demented spin that harks back to Christian Bale in ""American Psycho."" Only much yuckier. However, as nauseating as it is, ""Fresh"" is very well-worn. If you've seen ""Get Out"" and ""Promising Young Woman,"" which this is"

Even worse, he's the kind of foodie who insists on watching someone consume the dish he cooked for them and informing them of how much the ingredients cost. In the film's best scene, Stan's character, Steve, pushes a plate of pasta topped with a single murderous meatball toward Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones), the film's heroine, while holding forth on his personal journey into starting a monstrous meal-kit service as an instrumental version of ""Exit Music (for a Film)"" plays. It's a facsimile of a bad date, where one party drones on about their interests and the other gets in the occasional question, only Noa is in chains, and before she takes a bite, she feels obliged to ask if the meat is her own. Fresh is the directorial debut of Mimi Cave and was written by Ibiza's Lauryn Kahn (a former assistant of Adam McKay's, who is one of the producers), and it's never as daring as it is in that particular sequence, when Noa plasters on a smile and opens her mouth because playing along is her best chance at getting away. The film, which premiered at Sundance in January, is a horror comedy, though its horror is never gnarly enough and its comedy doesn't have enough teeth (rim shot!). What it does have going for it is a tremendously enjoyable Stan, whose razor-sharp jawline is outlandish enough to read as funny when it needs to, and who plays Steve as a West Coast answer to Patrick Bateman, a well-dressed professional with high-end taste, corny taste in music, and a smile handsome enough to obscure the coldness of his eyes. Steve and Noa have a meet-cute in a supermarket one night, and he's disarmingly fumbling, lacing his self-deprecating flirtations with mentions of the family members he is headed to visit. Noa, worn out from the apps, allows herself to believe that she has actually met someone worthwhile the old-fashioned way. And Steve turns out to be an ideal suitor, at least at first. They share intimacies over cocktails and fall into bed together, but only after he takes a moment to ask if they're going too fast (""I don't think I've ever heard a guy say that before,"" Noa marvels). He's a doctor. He owns a luxuriously appointed modernist house in the hills. He doesn't think it's too soon for them to spend the weekend together - in fact, he plans a getaway for them that turns out to be fateful. If Fresh had more of a satirical edge, it might have lingered in this space a while longer, devoting more time to the weariness that leaves Noa so ready to let her guard down and buy into Steve's suspicious perfection.

You might see Promising Young Woman in screenwriter Lauryn Kahn's scathing commentary on the horrors of modern dating, or Get Out in her shrewd use of horror tropes to amplify them. There are shades of American Psycho in its acid sense of humor, and Hannibal in its taste for luxury. But director Mimi Cave, in her feature directorial debut, corrals these influences into a film that lives up to its title. If Fresh stumbles on the way to its own finish line, it's still a hell of a way to launch a career. The first act of Fresh plays more or less like a rom-com. Just when Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones of Hulu's Normal People) decides she's fed up with dating, she meets Steve (Sebastian Stan), a handsome plastic surgeon who shares her taste for Old Fashioneds and dark jokes. (On their first date, they toast ironically to the fact that both of them have dead parents.) It may not be true love - Noa declares herself too hardened to believe in such things - but it feels like a genuine connection. So she lets herself indulge in what her best friend Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs) quite reasonably describes as ""the straight girl's fantasy come true,"" and agrees to let Steve whisk her away to a romantic getaway in the woods. At this point, over half an hour into the 114-minute film, the other shoe drops. The eerie opening credits roll - white text warping over disorienting close-ups of floors, paintings and what looks like pools of fresh blood - and Fresh reveals itself as the horror story it truly is. Fresh is more fun without spoilers, but it's not especially difficult to guess what Steve's terrible secret is. If the wink-wink wordplay in the official plot synopsis doesn't give it away, Kahn's script and Cave's visual approach drop plenty of hints long before Steve comes out with it. It's a testament to the ballsiness of Kahn's script, though, that Steve's sick motives are just the tip of the iceberg. The real narrative shocks lay in how they manifest, and the gruesome consequences that ripple from them. As Steve, Stan gives one of the most arresting performances of his career. In early scenes, he's an eminently reasonable romantic lead - the kind of guy you totally believe could get a girl's number at the grocery store with a cutesy anecdote about Cotton Candy grapes. But it's when the character's true nature is revealed that Stan rises to his full potential, channeling Patrick Bateman while dancing to Animotion's ""Obsession"" in his kitchen or monologuing to an unfortunately captive audience. That Edgar-Jones is able to maintain her footing against such unhinged charisma is a feat in itself. Even backed into the most desperate of corners, her Noa projects some inner reservoir of strength and wit that keeps the viewer from ever losing sight of the real hero. The true star"
249,AWM_Doc9_Fresh,AWM_Doc9_Fresh,AWM,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"Modern dating can make a girl feel like a real slab of meat - at least, that's the central thesis of Mimi Cave's debut Fresh, a horror-comedy with its teeth filed down to stubs. ""Hopefully, this'll make for a good story,"" Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) tells her BFF Mollie (Jojo T Gibbs) before she heads off on a date with the most blandly vile man you can imagine: he monologues about acid reflux, tells her she'd look prettier in a dress, spouts some racism at their waiter, and then calls Noa a ""bitch"" when she doesn't want to kiss him. When Noa gets back home, she tries to message another guy. He immediately responds with a dick pic. So who could blame her for ignoring every red flag presented by Steve (Sebastian Stan), who approaches her in a grocery store and jokes about how cotton candy grapes really do taste like cotton candy. Steve seems all too perfect: he loves to dance in the middle of his living room, he doesn't want to rush into sex, and he isn't on social media (which the film treats as immediately suspect, but I would argue is the romantic ideal). Noa complains that dating reduces us all to ""the perfect projection"", but she's just as willing to play into romcom fantasy: she's a ""pancakes out of a bag"" kind of girl, he's a sophisticated cocktail connoisseur. As Mollie points out: ""It's a straight girl's fantasy come true!"" It's a very relatable sort of hypocrisy. And when Steve whisks Noa away for a weekend out in nature, we're meant to read it as passionate and spontaneous - right up to the moment the film's title belatedly drops, around half an hour in, and we find out that he's actually a cannibal. Not a hobbyist cannibal, mind you, but a professional one, carving up women for wealthy clients while keeping them chained in his basement so the meat stays fresh. But Cave's film proves that there's a clear difference between clever metaphors and satisfying ones. The way Steve looks Noa dead in the eyes and says ""I'm taking your ass"" is a very dark but funny joke. And Cave, certainly, leans into the film's tongue-in-cheek quality. Fresh is shot by cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski, known for his work on both Hereditary and Midsommar, and the camera lurches around Steve's mid-century basement dungeon (quite nice if you take it out of context) in queasy disbelief at what's going on. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Steve is carving up body parts - for human meatballs and human prosciutto - while dancing to Peter Cetera's ""Restless Heart"". In another scene, he trudges into Noa's room, whining about how exhausting it is to chop up women all day. Stan has clearly been directed to give us Patrick Bateman with a Hannibal Lecter garnish, and it's effective for what it is. But Bateman - of Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho - always represented a somewhat outsized vision of male narcissism, and Fresh can't"

Music video director Mimi Cave adds some glitz to Adam McKay disciple Lauryn Kahn's script in her feature debut, but the film lacks the necessary bite either in its body horror or humor to truly pull off its cannibalistic commentary. To even get to the fun, Fresh asks a high price: Weathering Noa's (Daisy Edgar-Jones) played-out dating app horror stories and a psychopathic meet-cute with grocery store creep Steve (Sebastian Stan) that's clearly leading nowhere good. This goes on for a good half-hour-during which the starry-eyed and bland Noa claims Steve is cute (he is, in a movie star way), funny (he is not, even in a movie star way), and charming (he doesn't openly neg her)-before we finally get to the title card and the meat (ha!) of the movie. It's a bold move that would've worked wonders if it all didn't feel a little predictable. As the movie unveils its bloody scenario, it plays into tropes to such an extent that it can feel like a sketch about Dating In The Modern World spun out from the idea of ""What would really happen in 50 Shades of Grey?"" Except for the ""having a Black friend (Jojo T. Gibbs), often queer, who is the only person with a brain in their head"" thing. That's just a comedy trope brought in for support, because there's no way that Anastasia Steele would ever have a Black friend. As Noa comes to terms with the terrible situation she and countless other women have found themselves in, the film finds its strongest material. As Cave lays out the meticulously decorated floorplan with a glossy camera, Kahn walks us through the situation while planting all the necessary (if sometimes seemingly arbitrary) details for the rest of the plot. Throughout the second act, which can otherwise be a little workmanlike in its presentation of the facts and setting, Cave breaks things up with a few excellent sequences playing to her strengths with sound and rhythm. Stan (while mostly good at his Patrick Date-man during the rest of the film) is charmingly strange in the musical moments, dancing with enough candid verve that you almost don't mind that these scenes can feel like watered-down versions of Oscar Isaac's narcissistic Ex Machina jam sesh. Some of the character's other behaviors take you out of the action as you start to contemplate how in the world he's gotten away with this for so long. We're asked to believe that Steve is both a hardened sociopath and a total chump, meticulously planning and building a seduction-dungeon-surgery-distribution-consumption pipeline while also falling for the dumbest, most blatant ruse in the ""get away from the killer"" handbook. Part of this plays to Fresh's larger themes (men are jokes, relationships/dating can be consumptive/commodifying, some women are Stockholmed into being enablers) but with Stan and Edgar-Jones playing it so straight, these and other glossed"
251,TMW_Doc1_Annihilation,TMW_Doc1_Annihilation,TMW,Sci-Fi,Positive,Annihilation,"IT HASN'T been an easy road for Annihilation, Natalie Portman's ambitious new sci-fi movie. Hotly anticipated for months, writer and director Alex Garland's follow-up to his incredibly well received Ex Machina, was dumped by its studio, Paramount, outside of North America and China, leaving it to be picked up by Netflix. On the one hand, its Netflix distribution means a lot more people will see this excellent and provocative film. On the other, it's a real shame that Australians won't be able to experience Annihilation on a big screen. And what an experience it is. Absorbing and hypnotic, Annihilation is the best kind of sci-fi film - the kind that challenges and subverts the genre, all the while introducing new ideas that you'll see in films to come. Portman plays Lena, a former army ranger and biologist who specialises in the genetic programming of cells and how they propagate. Her husband disappeared on a mysterious mission a year earlier, that is until he appears in their house, with no memory of how he got there or where he's been. When he falls violently ill, a government team transports him and Lena to a secret base. Here, Lena meets psychologist Dr Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who tells Lena about The Shimmer, an electromagnetic field that is rapidly spreading from a lighthouse on the coast of Florida. For the past three years, anything and anyone that's ventured into The Shimmer hasn't returned, until Lena's husband. Lena joins the next expedition into The Shimmer, an all-women team alongside Dr Ventress, paramedic Anya (Gina Rodriguez), physicist Josie (Tessa Thompson) and surveyor Cass (Tuva Novotny). Everyone is broken or lost in some way, volunteering for what is effectively a suicide mission, but they are also all scientists, curious and capable. Once inside, it's clear they're not in Kansas anymore. The team immediately lose days, unable to remember stepping inside the zone or how they came to be camped where they are. The compass and all communications equipment are rendered useless. Inside The Shimmer, DNA is refracted and swapped, creating mutant species across everything - plants that form human shapes, alligators with shark teeth. Visually, Annihilation introduces aesthetics that you haven't seen on screen before - the imagery is spectacular to behold. And unlike most sci-fi or genre films, it embraces colour with every sequence popping off the screen. The shimmering effect itself is like an oil-slick, superimposed on top of everything, like an ethereal filter. Annihilation really could've benefited from a cinematic release. While it certainly borrows from the likes of Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey, Annihilation is a very different kind of movie. It has those intense moments you'd expect of an expedition into the unknown but what it does really well is quiet moments - conversations about self-destruction and purpose. That oscillation and balance is reflected in the score, which is often underlined by a soft, acoustic, almost indie-country melody, giving you moments to breathe and take it all in. Annihilation delights"
252,TMW_Doc2_Annihilation,TMW_Doc2_Annihilation,TMW,Sci-Fi,Positive,Annihilation,"Fission occurs when cells replicate and then divide. The process involves a single cell that splits itself in two, thereby negating its original form in service of two distinct cells. Growth and healing rely on this otherwise violent act, which signals Nature's impulse to self-destruct in order to create. It's a theme that prevails throughout Annihilation, writer-director Alex Garland's film of Jeff VanderMeer's 2014 novel. A microscopic view of cell division recurs as the film's central motif, lovingly integrated into Garland's visual and narrative choices. But the horrible beauty of the Kantian sublime dominates this intelligent, aesthetically wondrous production, leaving the viewer with much to contemplate about our human biases toward the essence of creation. (After all, while the rapid growth of, say, bacteria in the human body has been described as a disease, it's a time of prosperity in the microcosm of the bacterial world.) Conceptual as such ideas may be, Garland never forgets to mirror them with human drama. Indeed, within Annihilation's visceral yet thoughtful science-fiction context, his characters undergo fission to either self-destruct or become something new. Garland is ideally suited to adapt VanderMeer's book. During his early career as a novelist and screenwriter, he collaborated with British filmmaker Danny Boyle (and others) on several original screenplays that represent some of the best genre material in the last two decades. After a disappointing adaptation of his book The Beach in 2000, Garland worked with Boyle on the first true zombie reinvention of the twenty-first century, 28 Days Later... (2002), followed by the underseen space odyssey Sunshine (2007). He later wrote the screenplays for Never Let Me Go (2010) and the cult favorite Dredd (2012), proving his ability to alternate between substantive genre work or a severe comic book world. He finally directed his feature debut Ex Machina in 2014, earning a deserved Academy Award nomination for his screenplay, while his film won the Oscar for best visual effects. In each effort, Garland the writer incorporates powerful human exchanges into a complex science-fiction scenario. His ability to intertwine an accessible, emotional narrative with ideas explored by some of the genre's headiest practitioners puts him in the same arena as Philip K. Dick. For Annihilation, Garland chose aspects from each entry in VanderMeer's ""Southern Reach Trilogy"" to synthesize the author's complex, sometimes abstract conclusions for the screen. To borrow a term from the film, Garland refracts the novel rather than provide a faithful adaptation, bending the material from one medium into another to fit the requirements of cinema, as the best book-to-film adaptations do. It opens with a shot of a meteorite-that most efficient delivery system of apocalyptic horrors from The Day Of The Triffids to The Blob-falling to Earth and striking a lighthouse on the southeast coast of the United States. Mutated plants and animals have spread from this central location, surrounded by a living wall called ""the Shimmer."" After this early scene, a framing device gives the film its structure: Lena (Natalie Portman, in a wonderful, mature"
253,TMW_Doc3_Annihilation,TMW_Doc3_Annihilation,TMW,Sci-Fi,Positive,Annihilation,"There are ample reasons to be both excited and concerned about Annihilation. It's the writer-director Alex Garland's follow-up to his hugely acclaimed breakout Ex Machina and its $55m budget catapults him into a bigger, riskier league, the stakes immensely higher than before. For his studio-funded debut, he's chosen to adapt Jeff VanderMeer's award-winning novel, packed with visceral horror, weighty ideas and unusual storytelling. While its fanbase is passionate, it's difficult, some say ""unfilmable"" territory and the result has caused problems for Paramount, which was reportedly spooked by test audiences finding it too ""intellectual"" and ""complicated"". The film finished production almost two years ago and to avoid what was seen as a box office risk, the company ended up selling the rights internationally to Netflix, who will debut it just weeks after the US release.Lena (Natalie Portman), a biologist, is in a daze. Her soldier husband (Oscar Isaac) is missing in action and without him, she is struggling to focus on what remains of her life. But when he suddenly returns, her brief hope that normality will ensue is shattered when his odd behavior turns into something far more destructive. He's hospitalized and she's whisked away by a psychologist (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who informs her that his mission took him inside ""the shimmer"", a rapidly expanding area that's taken the lives of everyone who has entered, bar him. She soon joins a new mission to find out what's inside and discover whether she can save her husband's life. It's a similar strategy to the one behind the surprise streaming launch of The Cloverfield Paradox, which saw global audiences all enjoy the same feeling of intense disappointment simultaneously earlier this month. But Garland's insistence that the film remain true to his vision, avoiding studio tweaks, suggests that perhaps this might be a different case. Rather than offloading a turkey, might the studio recently wounded by the box office failure of Mother! be scared by another fascinating yet audience-unfriendly oddity? While it reportedly takes giant left turns from its source material, there's still something admirably uncompromising about Annihilation. The well-trodden formula of a group of experts/soldiers/horny teens being picked off by a malevolent force is structurally present but it's not presented in the same generic package we've grown tired with. Garland has far more on his mind than how to creatively dispatch a list of ciphers and his film is wonderfully unknowable, a crackling tension underpinning the unpredictable narrative. There's an unnerving chill about the horror that lies ahead because we're never really sure what form it will take. It's hugely refreshing, and remarkably uncommon, to watch a genre film that revolves around intelligent characters reacting intelligently to fantastical events. The team is made up of briskly efficient problem-solvers who remain practical and focused while dealing with otherworldly mayhem. Unlike with so many superficially similar films, as an audience we understand and empathize with the decision-making process, the script never sacrificing its smarts for suspense. It's tightly constructed and devoid of unnecessary exposition"
254,TMW_Doc4_Annihilation,TMW_Doc4_Annihilation,TMW,Sci-Fi,Positive,Annihilation,"In the spoiler-sensitive environment of today's entertainment, there may be people who resent the opening scenes of Annihilation, which gives away most of the movie's direction. A biologist named Lena (Natalie Portman) has survived a cataclysmic event. Sitting in an isolation chamber, surrounded by unnerved people in hazmat suits, she's interrogated about what just happened to her. In the process, she reveals who among the yet-to-be-introduced cast of characters survives, and who dies. And the scene makes it clear that while some of her companions may be alive, she's the only one who made it back to report. This framing device can't quite be called foreshadowing: the details Lena lays out are too solid to be shadows. They're just fore-facts. And they hang over Annihilation with a sense of leaden inevitability. But it's a mark of success for the film that even knowing the outcome doesn't disperse the tension. Annihilation is a portentous movie, and a cerebral one. It's gorgeous and immersive, but distancing. It's exciting more in its sheer ambition and its distinctiveness than in its actual action. And by giving away so many details about the ending up front, writer-director Alex Garland (Ex Machina) seems to be emphasizing that Annihilation isn't about who-will-live dynamics, or the fast mechanics of action scenes. It's about the slow, subdued journey Lena and the others take into the unknown, and how it affects them emotionally. Throughout the film, which loosely adapts the first book in a trilogy by Jeff VanderMeer, Garland returns to Lena's after-action reports to add some insight into what she was feeling and thinking during her experience. But framing aside, he opens with Lena mourning her husband Kane (Oscar Isaac, who also starred in Ex Machina), who disappeared a year ago on a covert military mission. Lena is a seven-year Army vet herself, and her current career as a Johns Hopkins biologist doesn't provide any hint of how tough and ruthless she can be in a combat situation. But when circumstances lead her to join a team investigating an eerie phenomenon known as The Shimmer, she straps her rucksack on and picks up a rifle like she never put it down. The Shimmer started at the site of a meteor impact and has been slowly growing, engulfing a patch of land in an energy field that looks like a pulsing oil slick wiped over the air. Multiple teams of investigators and soldiers have been dispatched into the area over the past year, and none have reported back or returned. It's a compelling mystery, and potentially even an exciting challenge to the right kind of person. But Garland is more interested in using The Shimmer to explore the human urge toward self-destruction. Since all-male Army squads have failed to conquer the region, Lena's team of explorers represent a new tactic: they're all women. Psychologist Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh), physicist Josie (Tessa Thompson), scientist Cass (Tuva Novotny), and paramedic Anya (Gina Rodriguez) barely comment on the gender choice. But the"
255,TMW_Doc5_Annihilation,TMW_Doc5_Annihilation,TMW,Sci-Fi,Positive,Annihilation,"To call Annihilation writer-director Alex Garland the thinking geek's new sci-fi guru is probably to jinx his box-office chances. Look where thoughtfulness got Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049. But Garland is the real-deal for generating rattling tension and mind-blowing mojo. Annihilation, an eco-thriller based on the first book in the acclaimed Southern Reach trilogy by Jeff VanderMeer, gives Garland a shot at stretching the cerebral and scare muscles he flexed so brilliantly in his 2015 directing debut, Ex Machina, a fierce and acidly funny take on artificial intelligence that asked provoking question about what defines humanity or lack of same. The provocations have intensified but the laughs are few in Annihilation since its five female protagonists are playing a deadly game. A dynamite Natalie Portman, radiating ferocity and feeling, stars as Lena, an ex-Army biologist on an expedition into the ""Shimmer,"" an overgrown, undulating forest located in Florida (but shot in the U.K.) that seems to be infecting everything it spreads its spores on. The government has cordoned off the space, known as Area X, but who are the Feds kidding. The Shimmer is threatening to shim on inhabited areas and it means business. The trip is organized by Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh, making sanity look anything but). No one came back from the last trek, except for Lena's husband Kane (Ex Machina's Oscar Isaac in superb form). Kane has showed up at home after a year looking the same but acting body-and-spirit snatched. Lena wants answers. So do audiences. And so do her fellow voyagers into the unknown, physicist Josie (Tessa Thompson), anthropologist Cass (Tuva Novotny) and paramedic Anya (Gina Rodriguez). All the actors come up aces, but Rodriquez deserves cheers for erasing any trace of her sweet character on the CW's Jane the Virgin. Her breakdown scene is one for the books on batshit crazy. In fact, all five women display self-destructive tendencies that intensify with continued expose to the Shimmer. Ok, the Shimmer sounds like something out of a shampoo commercial, but Garland makes sure the area's surface allure hints at the dread of what lies beneath. Annihilation isn't a creature feature, though a few beasts show up at different intervals (oh that albino gator!). It's the violence of the mind that Garland plumbs with such merciless menace. As the women cut deeper into the forest and this review edges into spoiler territory, it's crucial not to reveal the film's tantalizing secrets, many of them found at the lighthouse which marks the end of Lena's journey. What you need to know is that Garland blends hardcore suspense and intellectual curiosity with the skill of a master. Cinematographer Rob Hardy creates indelible images of beauty and terror set to a pulsating electronic score by Ben Salisbury and Portishead's Geoff Barrow. Other cinematic tropes are evoked, from the literal monsters of Alien (yes, a chest cavity is breached) and to the subconscious anxieties of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.

It's jam-packed with great actors; it's based on a brilliant, award-winning novel by Jeff VanderMeer; and it is directed by Alex Garland, the mastermind behind indie breakout Ex Machina. And yet, despite being arguably beautiful, this movie fails on multiple levels. Incoherent, implausible, and often downright embarrassing, it verges on self-parody. What's frustrating about Annihilation is that the acting is superb, and the concept design is mostly gorgeous. Immersed in the film's macabre, trippy landscapes, it's easy to get lost in the imagery and forget that the plot has fallen to pieces until about halfway through the story.The film's setup is immediately intriguing. A meteorite has crashed to Earth and brought a phenomenon called ""the shimmer"" with it. A gooey, nacreous membrane wall rises up around the crash site, and it's expanding to encompass towns, a lighthouse, and swamplands. Soldiers from a mysterious organization called the Southern Reach have been passing through the shimmer into ""Area X"" never to return. Except one, that is. Kane (Oscar Isaac), a special forces agent married to biologist Lena (Natalie Portman), has reappeared with no explanation, nor any memory, and very little time to live.To find out what happened, Lena volunteers for a scientific mission that's headed into Area X. With her are a psychologist (Jennifer Jason Leigh, in full deadly weirdo mode), a physicist (Tessa Thompson), a paramedic (Gina Rodriguez), and an anthropologist (Tuva Novotny). At first, the world inside Area X is so mesmerizing that it's a delightful ride. The air shimmers with pearlescent rainbows; colorful mutant flowers have covered abandoned homes; and animals have become impossible hybrids like shark-alligators and deer-birds.Our characters wander in a daze, unable to think straight, slowly descending into a terrifying, dreamlike state. Watching them, we genuinely feel like we've entered an alien landscape.Silver body paint, required?And then they start getting clues about what happened to Kane. Without giving anything away, let's just say that the movie goes from exploring how science deals with the unknown to asserting that science is actually a bunch of mystical mumbo-jumbo that involves silver body paint and painfully bad representations of how DNA works. This is particularly tragic because the novel that inspired this movie is a standout example of how to bring plausible science into a story that's nevertheless surreal and mysterious.The plot of Annihilation quickly devolves into something you'll recognize from 1950s B-movies. But instead of embracing the cheesiness of its underlying tale, Alex Garland lards on layers of foolish randomness to give the illusion of depth. We get one horrible, awkwardly-acted flashback to a guilty moment in Lena's past-which basically feels like an excuse to see Portman naked. But don't think too hard about that! The film just wants you to stare at these fungus skull sculptures, zoomy lights, and gooey CGI blobs. Plus we've got some empty assertions about how DNA is really weird, man.Annihilation desperately wants to be about the fragility of human identity and the existential dread of the unknown."
257,TMW_Doc7_Annihilation,TMW_Doc7_Annihilation,TMW,Sci-Fi,Negative,Annihilation,"The new movie ""Annihilation"" feels like a vanity project in a very specific way: until a few strikingly inspired moments near the end, it plays like a film made for no personal need, no sense of inquiry or effort to understand situations, characters, or the universe-rather, it appears made to impress. What's more, that strategy has, for the most part, paid off with critics. ""Annihilation"" is one of the dullest shiny objects in recent cinema, a work of a sort of bureaucratic hubris; it's evidence of how studio movies that escape from the longtime critical bugbears of franchises and superheroes, and that appear to be made for (a word that I utter with an eye-roll) ""adults,"" get graded on an astonishingly generous and distorting curve. ""Annihilation"" is a science-fiction movie set in a world not very different from this one, not a dystopian future or a technological wonderland but, rather, a current-day world that is jolted off kilter by one peculiar event. It's a setup that depends not on the ingenious abstractions and artifices of a film like ""Black Panther,"" which uses the conventions of genre to create a movie driven by powerful ideas; ""Annihilation"" is instead dependent on grafts-on the one big twist inflicted on contemporary society-but it offers neither a satisfying view of the current-day people who confront the implications of the event nor of the society in which the thing happens. Rather, ""Annihilation"" squeezes and narrows its characters and the world at large to fit the tight confines of a plot issuing from the big deal and turns a potentially cosmic vision of metaphysical distortion into an unintentional comedy of self-derision. The big event is a sharp, swift beam from outer space that pierces the atmosphere and blasts the base of an ancient lighthouse on the barren shore of a nature preserve. Its effects are first, albeit obliquely, manifested through the pain of its protagonist, Lena (Natalie Portman), a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and seven-year Army veteran, who is in mourning for her husband, Kane (Oscar Isaac), who was in the military and was reported killed in action a year ago. She's home, renovating the house to embark symbolically on her new life, when Kane shows up. But he doesn't seem like himself; he's emotionally remote, and Lena can't get a story out of him. Then he collapses, bleeding. En route to the hospital, the ambulance in which Kane is being transported and Lena is accompanying him is waylaid by a squad of black S.U.V.s and a batch of masked agents who purloin Kane and administer a knockout injection to Lena, who awakens in a secret hospital-like facility. There, she's attended by a psychiatrist, Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who explains that Kane is still alive; that he was part of a mission to enter a zone, centered on the lighthouse, that's surrounded by a rainbow-like curtain of light called ""the Shimmer""; and that Kane is the only person who came back.

This statement, or variations on it, is uttered repeatedly throughout the film Annihilation, generally by characters who have returned from ""the Shimmer,"" a deeply weird sci-fi zone in which the customary laws of physics, biology, time, and memory no longer prevail. It is also a statement that many viewers may be inclined to utter when asked precisely what it was they just watched. Ambiguity is not necessarily a bad thing in a motion picture. But Annihilation, the director Alex Garland's adaptation of the first novel of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach trilogy, is so resolutely vague, so eager to confound, that its ambiguity becomes itself ambiguous. Does it intend to let viewers balance competing interpretations? Or does it simply not know what it is trying to say? Though Garland's film is decidedly creepy and often ravishing to look at, it's hard to shake the sense that, beneath its highbrow patina, it is an intellectual muddle. The movie opens with a biologist, Lena (Natalie Portman), being questioned by a man in a hazmat suit. He wants to know about her experience in the Shimmer, also known as ""Area X."" How long was she in there, what did she eat, what happened to the other members of her expedition? I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. Flash backward in time. Lena's husband, Kane (Oscar Isaac) is a soldier, and he has been long missing and presumed dead. But one weekend, as she weeps inconsolably, he reappears mysteriously. (In a touch that approximates the definition of ""too on the nose,"" the musical accompaniment is Crosby, Stills & Nash's ""Helplessly Hoping,"" and Lena sees him walking up the stairs to the bedroom precisely as the song reaches the line ""Stand by the stairway, you'll see something ... "") Is he a ghost? Has she lost her mind? He isn't, and she hasn't. Kane has indeed come home, but he is scarcely a shell of his former self. His military unit had been among the first expeditions into the Shimmer, but he has no memory of the mission at all. She asks him questions about what happened. He replies with I don't knows. It becomes clear, however, that he is severely ill. The two soon find themselves at a secure facility where a psychologist, Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh), explains to Lena that her now-comatose husband is dying. Ventress also explains the Shimmer, a dome-like forcefield that arose from a meteor crash site in the wilds of northwest Florida. Small at first, it has continued to expand across the Panhandle, until it now looks like a monstrous soap bubble, colors washing wetly across its surface. No one quite knows what it is-""a religious event, an extraterrestrial event, a higher dimension,"" Ventress offers. But despite repeated expeditions, ""nothing comes back."" (Kane is evidently the sole exception.) Ventress herself will be leading another team into the Shimmer shortly, and Lena, who wants to know what happened to her husband, volunteers to join. For"

Now imagine that prism as something enormous, covering a wide swath of land. And then imagine it being possible to walk into that prism, into that separate world within a world. In the movie ""Annihilation,"" that prism is called the ""shimmer,"" and no one knows where it came from. However, it's certain that it's getting bigger, and that does not bode well. ""Annihilation"" is an attempt to make a thinking-person's sci-fi movie, and director Alex Garland (""Ex Machina""), in adapting the novel by Jeff VanderMeer, has created a sober movie full of interesting ideas. But he neglected to remember that thinking people also like a little drama with their science fiction. On that score, ""Annihilation"" comes up short. This is not to say that the movie lacks incident. There's action and suspense, and there are eerie moments. But ""Annihilation"" fails to do the essential thing. It fails to motivate the central characters. Much of the film, for example, involves people going on an expedition into the shimmer, which could easily turn out to be a suicide mission. Yet, not one of them has an active motive for doing so. No one has fire and purpose and a reason to risk everything. Instead it's just people stumbling into things, either because they're depressed, or they feel they have nothing to lose, or they're doing as they've been told. It's just dull to watch characters that, at most, care no more about what they're doing than you do - and that's true even if one of them is played by Natalie Portman and another is played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. Monsters could be eating their friends. The fate of human civilization could be in their hands. If they don't have a strong desire to overcome obstacles and accomplish something, the movie is reduced to just a bunch of stuff happening. ""Annihilation"" starts well. Natalie Portman is a biology professor at Johns Hopkins University, whose soldier husband (Oscar Isaac) disappeared a year ago while on a secret mission. She remains grief stricken; and then one night, he reappears, but it's no joyful reunion. He can tell her nothing of where he's been, and it soon becomes clear that he's seriously ill. Soon, they're both in a military hospital, where one of the doctors, a military psychiatrist played by Leigh, tells the professor all about the shimmer. Any movie that gives Jennifer Jason Leigh a major role in which she gets to act spooky and weird can't be all bad. ""Annihilation"" is also, rather in passing, a women's war movie, in that the psychiatrist leads a team of uniformed women into the shimmer. That's something, too. But these are the kinds of things you have to think about to appreciate. ""Annihilation"" leaves audiences with plenty of time to think - about their taxes, about what to eat when the movie is over,"
260,TMW_Doc10_Annihilation,TMW_Doc10_Annihilation,TMW,Sci-Fi,Negative,Annihilation,"I gather the taxonomy of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach novels goes something like, family: speculative fiction; genus: Weird fiction; species: New Weird. In adapting Annihilation, the first book in the trilogy, writer/director Alex Garland has seemingly pledged fealty, attempting a speculative film with ""weird"" baked into its genetic code. Weird is the film's watchword, its true north, its ""why we fight."" It steers the visuals - the mutated flora and fauna living within the mysterious Area X - and the story, a schematic of flashbacks within flashbacks and a headtrip climax that inevitably begs comparison to 2001: A Space Odyssey's exit into the mystic. With so much weirdness, then, why does it all feel so ... straight? And why do I feel like a bummed-out tourist gone home with dashed hopes? ""I was promised a new-millennium mindfuck, and all I got was this crummy pick-the-bodies-off horror."" To be clear, nobody promised me anything; still, expectations were raised - by Garland's encouraging directorial debut, 2014's Ex Machina, a nearly baked speculative fiction about the responsible rearing of robots, and by VanderMeer's reputation (highly regarded, though I admit I haven't the read the books). To continue the caveats, that ""pick-the-bodies-off"" observation isn't much of a spoiler - the fates of certain characters are revealed in the film's opening minutes - but if you want to go into Annihilation blind, better skip to the last paragraph. Natalie Portman plays Lena, a biologist and academic, former military. Her husband Kane (played by Oscar Isaac with an unplaceable accent) was sent on a mission into Area X, a stretch of land impacted by some kind of extraterrestrial object and irrevocably altered by it. Every mission going into Area X has failed, and its shimmering borders are slowly expanding, threatening to swallow cities and even states whole. Hoping to find answers, Lena volunteers for the next exploratory mission - this time, an all-female unit made up of scientists and medical personnel. I am all in for a ""sheroes of STEM"" actioner, and Garland really has cast this thing to perfection, including Jennifer Jason Leigh as a psychologist who would most certainly fail her own psych evaluation, Tessa Thompson as a physicist carting heavy emotional baggage, and Gina Rodriguez, gleefully vinegaring any memories of her sweeter-tempered Jane the Virgin character. But as they tromp through Area X and tangle with its weirdnesses - navigation and communication instruments gone haywire, a disorientation that causes the unit to lose memory (whole days seem to disappear), and that mutated fauna, out for the kill - Annihilation settles into a routine-feeling horror. The performances aren't routine, and neither is the score by Ex Machina composers Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow, adding an emotional complexity with its mix of heartland guitar, spooky AF strings, and submerged-sounding synths. But those whale-song-like synths recall in fits Arrival's score, and by association how much better that film handled a story with open-ended questions; also, how confident you felt its mysteries were by design, and how"

So I thought I'd re-up this piece from my old blog. It's 11 years old, but still accurate. After watching Minority Report last night, I was surprised to discover that most critics do not consider it to be an utter and complete piece of crap. Roger Ebert, in particular, had an absolutely gushing review, in which he praised the film for being ""a thriller and a human story, a movie of ideas that's also a whodunit."" Ebert is by all accounts a lovely human being, but every time I read something by him, I am reminded that he does not have the critical sense that God gave a roach. Even an insect that frolics in filth would be hard pressed to find any enjoyment in such a shiny, treacly, turkey of a film. Spielberg as director has found perhaps the perfect outlet for his glibness in this tale of precognitive saviors. The film grinds frictionlessly along, a remorselessly predictable blueprint for itself. Flawed hero, tragic backstory, clever chase scene, cleverer chase scene, cleverest chase scene, false antagonist, twist, real antagonist, reconciliation with perfectly domestic yet also spunky wife. Like the precogs, we can see it all coming and all going too; painful echoes of sentiment past sliding down our brainstems as we float weightlessly in an infinite vat of sentimental horseshit. The emotional core of the film is (you could predict it) the tragic backstory I mentioned. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is a efficient no-nonsense police guy in the precrime unit, snooping out murders before they happen. Beneath his gruff exterior and Hollywood good looks, though, lurks a sadness; his 5-year old disappeared from a public pool. Anderton's marriage collapsed, and now he takes drugs (ooooh...dark) and watches 3-D home movies of his son and wife. His heart is tugged while watching them and our heart is tugged while watching him; it's a testament to the power of film and to ""complex human feelings"", in Ebert's words. Said complex human feelings being: hey, losing a kid - that really sucks. If that happens to you, you've got to be deep, right? That is the extent of the film's character development; Anderton has no other discernible personality traits; nor does his wife. The film's stupid, by-the-numbers plot, it's utterly facile and familiar characters, are all supposed to be redeemed by dropping a murdered five-year old onto them from a great height. Before I had a kid myself, I found this sort of mindless, self-serving manipulation unpleasant. Now that I have a child of my own, who is actually a person rather than a trope, I find it even more detestable. At the end of the film, Anderton indignantly yells at his stupid standard-issue corrupt boss for manipulating his love for his child. Rarely have I seen a moment of such utterly clueless hypocrisy. The whole film is nothing but a giant machine designed to"

Since my early teens I've been stubbornly clinging to a copy of the October 1953 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction magazine, featuring the first installment of Isaac Asimov's The Caves of Steel, a mystery story set in a vast city of the future. I prize this particular issue not for anything inside but for the cover illustration by ""Emsh,"" the name future filmmaker Ed Emshwiller used to sign his artwork. In the foreground two transparent hands-one revealing human bones, the other metal ones-are shown in front of the vast reaches of an enclosed cityscape with pedestrians. This encouraged me to consider not only a future city but also how it might look to both a human and a robot detective. No story, by Asimov or anyone else, could do as much for my imagination as that Emsh cover. The only thing that came close was a single sentence by Damon Knight in his review of Asimov's novel, which may have been what led me to the novel and that issue of Galaxy in the first place: ""Asimov has turned a clear, ironic, and compassionate eye on every cranny of the City: the games children play on the moving streets; the legends that have grown up about deserted corridors; the customs and taboos in Section kitchens and men's rooms; the very feel, smell, and texture of those steel caves in which men live and die."" This helped me imagine a future city, though unlike the Emsh cover or A.I. Artificial Intelligence, it taught me nothing about what it might be like to be a robot. I became an SF fan because of such invitations to dream about the future, immense spaces, and one's own origins. Early SF movies like Metropolis (1926) offered all these invitations, and their poetics were later elaborated on by films such as Blade Runner (1982), which borrowed from other diverse sources, including neonoir and Shanghai Express. Less poetic evocations of otherworldly climes, like the original Star Wars, can also create some of this magic-provided their visions are fleeting, on-screen just long enough to tease the imagination; as in soft-core-porn bubble dances, the secret is not to show too much. (The Emsh Galaxy cover may show a lot of one cityscape, but it only suggests a narrative, leaving that mainly to the viewer.) The parallel with porn is more apparent when one reflects that most futuristic, gadget-ridden science fiction is selling something that has more to do with the present than the future: ""investing in the future"" is mostly about buying now, and the hype about ""experiencing the future"" through the latest technology is an invitation to dig into our pockets today. Maybe that's why most SF veers more toward the right than the left-because it's usually selling not the fancy trappings but the status quo.

263,DYV_Doc3_MinorityReport,DYV_Doc3_MinorityReport,DYV,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report,"Minority Report might take place some fifty years after the film was shot but the film's themes are still relevant almost twenty years later. This film marks the first collaboration between Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise. The film has audiences asking some important questions. What if we knew what was going to happen in the future? After you ask yourself the question, what if the person knowing this found out he was going to kill someone? This is the gist of the film, which is based on the Philip K. Dick short story. Another thing here is that the audience must be able to buy into the science early on in the film. This is key to being able to just sit back and enjoy the ride. If you're watching the film for the first time in 2020, the science is very believable. It's amazing how much of the science is catching up right in front of us. There's something to be said about the eye-dentification. Social media platforms already know our faces. Companies target us online because of internet cookies. One could look at author Philip K. Dick as a prophet in the world of science-fiction. In case you didn't know, Dick is also the man behind Blade Runner. One of the film's main themes is free will vs. determinism. The film handles this so beautifully. If we know our future, could we possibly do something to change it? The Department of PreCrime, at least in what we see on screen, is mostly focusing on preventing murders. This is where the three pre-cognitives are the main focus. Two twin males and one female share a common trait. They see the future and the visions appear on a giant screen. Together, they're able to see the future. They have no interaction with the outside world. The department's agents work to arrest people on the basis of the visions. PreCrime Captain John Anderton (Tom Cruise) has turned to drugs since his son, Sean, disappeared. Anderton is also separated from his wife, Lara (Kathryn Morris). Anderton just happens to have the unfortunate luck of being in the pre-cogs vision when DOJ agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is visiting the agency. Talk about bad luck! Anderton now goes on the run and PreCrime creator Dr. Iris Hineman (Lois Smith) tells him that Agatha (Samantha Morton) sometimes has a different vision. Dr. Hineman refers to this as a ""minority report."" There's a lot of mystery in the film surrounding the death of Ann Lively (Jessica Harper). She just happens to be Agatha's mother. The further we get into the film, Anderton learns that he's being framed. Meanwhile, Witwer starts studying the available footage and starts to believe the same. Anybody in the right mind would do what he does next. But what Witwer doesn't know is that the director and founder of PreCrime, Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow), is covering up the murder. Goodbye Witwer! In many aspects, Minority Report falls under the usual"

It's a murder charge in which the deed has yet to be committed. Due to the discovery of the Precogs, three humans with the special ability to predict unlawful activities approximately four days in advance of their occurrences, the crime rate has dropped by over 90% in the area. Anderton specializes in ""red ball"" situations (designated by an elaborate computer system synced to the Precogs brains that spits out colored wooden orbs), such as 1108, which are crimes of passion - since there's no premeditation, these murders can only be seen a few hours or minutes prior to the event. This new scheme is the ultimate invasion of privacy - and it's on the verge of sweeping the nation. Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is sent from the Attorney General of the United States to determine if there are any flaws in the system before the program spreads to other districts. Since humans run it, there will be inevitable glitches. The first problem occurs when John digs around the archives looking for a specific murder case in which the killer was apprehended but never identified. Each case is supposed to have three previsions, one from each Precog - the most powerful auger being the catatonic Agatha (Samantha Morton). But several of Agatha's files are missing. The following day, the divine trio have another visual prophecy - one in which Anderton himself is the murderer. In the future, automated eye scan devices identify everyone so that movements across the city cannot occur without government knowledge. It's a scarily authoritarian arrangement designed to demonstrate the oppression and faults of a Big Brother world. And it's just a piece of a rather impressive conceptualization of the dictatorial, slave-to-technology years to come, mixed with darker, noirish elements of grime and shadows (like an updated ""Blade Runner"" setting). Other visual accessories and indications of scientific advancements include an innovative, computerized workspace (in which files float across translucent screens - an idea frequently spoofed and copied), high-speed cars that move up and down skyscrapers, three-dimensional memory files, and rickety jetpacks. Additionally, Paul Verhoeven-styled, commercial-like news updates and invasive media is blasted through enormous monitors stationed throughout the city. As an action picture more predominantly than a thinking man's piece, the stunts and chases are nicely choreographed, further embellished with fitting music by John Williams. It's a light-hearted type of violent adventure along the lines of a futuristic Indiana Jones (or any of Schwarzenegger's sci-fi works), with cleverer escapes and showdowns, and subtle humor fused into the combat. The level of fantasy frequently rivals the severer science-fiction elements, radiating Spielberg's brand of lively storytelling. The blue-and-black, muted, desaturated cinematography sharply aids the tone of ""Minority Report,"" which, for a Philip K. Dick adaptation, possesses quite the focus on thrills and destruction over satire and criticism. And indeed, while the story is superbly complex, twisting and turning"
265,DYV_Doc5_MinorityReport,DYV_Doc5_MinorityReport,DYV,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report,"OVER THE past twenty years, the works of Philip K. Dick have become the hottest sf based-upons in Hollywood. Many have speculated on the reason. True believers think it's the cosmic inevitability of PKD's epistemological genius, which has the power to reach even the soul-dead executives of the major studios. (But these folks are, conversely, so outraged by how the holy writ has been distorted and defiled by movie makers that they wish the current and planned screen adaptations would just go away.) Others simply see the late great author's themes as highly relevant, and then some. Dickian ""paranoia"" about corporate and government iniquity certainly speaks even more eloquently to a society faced with a steady stream of news stories about Enrons, Halliburtons, and the frightening examples of governmental surveillance and detentions that have occurred since 9-11 and the passage of the PATRIOT Act. But Philip K. Dick isn't the only sf author to explore such issues. Nor is he the only author to ruminate on the nature of reality and humanity. As talented and timely a writer as Mr. Dick is, his Hollywood hot property status probably has less to do with him or his literary executors than it does with a gentleman named Ridley Scott. The film industry leeches on literature, it's true. But it absolutely feasts upon itself. Blade Runner (1982), a screenplay by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, based upon PKD's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, was directed with such style and verve by Scott that Hollywood took notice. That, despite the fact that the film did less than booming box office when it was first released. The full screen potential of science fiction could not be denied after Blade Runner (and Scott's previous space creature feature, Alien). Visual flair, philosophical substance, and kick-ass action can come together to make an entertaining and artistically compelling movie. Blade Runner proved that. Unfortunately, although major and minor studios as well as independent and international filmmakers have gone back to the well of Dickian fact and fiction again and again since 1982, none of the resulting films have equaled Scott's influential masterwork. But that doesn't keep them from trying. Steven Spielberg's Minority Report (2002) is the most recent high-profile entry. It's a handsome film-certainly better than A.I.-but ultimately rather tedious and falsely sentimental, as Spielberg films have a tendency to be. And now we have another PKD adaptation. A much, much different film that, while not a complete offense against the viewing public, manages to lose the wonder of its Dickian story in the pyrotechnics of conventional filmmaking. Paycheck, based on the 1953 Dick short story by the same name, features a screenplay by Dean Georgaris. And the adaptation isn't half bad. In some ways-sacrilege alert to all PKD devotees-it actually improves on the source material. My own feeling about Dick's original ""Paycheck"" is that it presents a dandy story concept but that the narrative collapses at the end. The basic conceit, as most of you probably remember,"

Set in the year 2054 in Washington, D.C., Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, who, having lost his son, now does his best to prevent murders before they happen as Chief of the elite Pre-Crime Division of the Justice Department. Assisting him are three genetically altered precognitives known as ""Pre-Cogs"" who are attached to machines that record their visions of murders which are ""set"" to occur anywhere from a few minutes to four days into the future. With each vision, two wooden balls roll out of the machine attachment, each one bearing the name of the killer and victim. As a result of this ""perfect"" system, Washington, D.C. is now murder free. (Let's face it, given our life and times, Dick should have set this scenario in 3054 to have any plausibility.) Believing the Pre-Cogs infallible, Anderton advocates nationalizing the Pre-Crime system, that is until the Justice Department questions the methods and techniques utilized by the Division and Anderton himself becomes the subject of a Pre-Cog vision seeing him committing a murder. Suddenly questioning the accuracy of the system (since he of course knows he's innocent and will continue to be innocent), Anderton goes on the run, stealing a female Pre-Cog named Agatha, setting us up for what now becomes a routine futuristic chase movie. Directed by Steven Spielberg, ""Minority Report"" reeks of the darker tone and color desaturation found in Spielberg's last futuristic foray, ""A.I."", a technique that works well in this type of film and once again is executed beautifully by long time Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. Hand in hand with Kaminski's artistic flair, are some dazzling special effects action sequences, including a chase on a vertical highway that is so impressive, you have to see it to believe it. (Warning - those with severe motion sickness may want to cover their eyes at this part.) Not to be outdone, many scenes which one would believe are special effects, are in fact, the result of elaborately and elegantly choreographed camera maneuvers which are expertly executed and utilized for maximum dramatic effect. Cruise performs admirably as Anderton, using physicality and controlled raw emotion to their best advantage as he manipulates not only his pursuers, but the audience as well. An excellent counterpoint to Cruise's energetic yet psychologically tormented Anderton is Samantha's Moore portrayal of Pre-Cog Agatha - tacit, ethereal and seemingly helpless. Max von Sydow, no stranger to the futuristic and fantastic (""Dune"", ""Judge Dredd"" and ""The Exorcist"") steps in as Anderton's superior, Bureau Director Burgess, exhibiting an almost fatherly pride in his protege Anderton while relative newcomer, Colin Farrell is perfectly cast as the bureaucratic FBI investigator Danny Witwer who"
267,DYV_Doc7_MinorityReport,DYV_Doc7_MinorityReport,DYV,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report,"Steven Spielberg's Minority Report is a busy film. It fills your eye and ear - and, even rarer, your mind. It speculates on the future and uses what it visualises to commentate on the present. Like its three ""pre-cogs"" - clairvoyant visionaries gifted with the power to foresee future events - it forewarns us of the shape of things to come - some of which are already here. The film's sheer timeliness is a great part of its importance. It's set in Washington DC, a metropolis whose murder rate has dropped to zero. Crimes are prevented before they can be committed - thanks to tapping into the pre-cogs' premonitions. But if the streets are safe, it's because the old watchword about the price of liberty being eternal vigilance has been given a sinister techno-twist. In Spielberg's futureworld, the price of liberty is eternal surveillance. For all its own impressive dystopian design and cyborg melodrama, a comparable film like Ridley Scott's Blade Runner was light on the way the future is already impacting on the here and now. Minority Report, based on a brilliant extrapolation from Philip K Dick's SF novel, pulls together what we see happening already in a world where people have their identities ""stolen"", machines ""judge"" our entitlement to be believed or not, and incarceration is sanctioned on suspicion of what we may do, not what we have done. In A Clockwork Orange, Stanley Kubrick foresaw the day a Minister of the Interior would brainwash criminals into subservience to the state and justify it because ""it works"". Spielberg's movie is the new, improved version of the proto-police state. It begins with what, for this director, is an uncommon kind of overture: sex and violence. Tom Cruise, head of the Pre-Crime Unit, stands on a podium. Before him, like instruments in an orchestra, are screens whose subliminal images, sourced from the clairvoyant pre-cogs, illustrate a crime passionel about to be committed. Like a conductor, Cruise waves his cybergloved hands accelerando in a race against time to pick 'n' mix the visual clues to the scene of the crime-to-be. This sequence alone crosses a new frontier in high-tech cinema. The airborne SWAT team, descending vertically on individual jet-propelled backpacks, make their arrest just before the jealous husband puts the knife in. He's whipped off to eternal hibernation, standing upright, to save space in prison. This prologue demo sets the stripcartoon style and pace of a movie that uses brainpower, not bubbles, to carry its message. Cruise is a flawed hero. His own child was abducted years before. The ""home movies"" he watches in his lonely high-rise home - actually images of ex-wife and lost child who ""materialise"" in his living-room in 3D - have a poignant melancholy suggestive of the loss of other values once real and dear to its citizens. Cruise's loss of his son is what motivates him to fight crime. Not for the first time in a Spielberg film, the violated family echoes the director's own childhood"

The best thing about it is pretty much everything else. After his unhappy fathomings of the future with ""A.I.,"" Spielberg has plunged back in and fished up something rich and strange. ""Minority Report"" is set in the year 2054, and Spielberg, who knows better than anyone how to knead the homely into the exotic, is careful to suggest that, for every shift in social mores, other details have stayed the same. Businessmen still wear a suit and tie to the office; policemen, on the other hand, race toward trouble spots not in a wailing squad car but in the belly of a giant hair dryer. The idea, one presumes, is that any terrified suspects can be rapidly coiffed into submission, but that is the least of their worries. What really gets to them is Precrime. This is the flourishing, psychojudicial field in which John Anderton (Tom Cruise) currently toils and spins. The premise is simple, in the way that eugenics was simple: the state-or, rather, Washington, D.C., where the scheme is under trial before it goes national- is now able to unearth a murder before it happens, and so prevent it from coming to pass. The authorities get the names of the perpetrator and the victim; thus equipped, they merely have to work out the location, hop into the hair dryer, and trust that they make it in time. Such are the conditions of the opening sequence, which lasts a good twenty minutes, and which reminds us that, when it comes to stepping on the gas of a plot, Spielberg can still summon the contagious excitement of a young buck. Yet the texture of the material here could hardly be more grownup; to see a Spielberg film that starts with both sex and violence, as ""Minority Report"" does, is one of the more unexpected events in a moviegoer's life, like coming across a tea party in the middle of late Peckinpah. Knowing the hook of ""Minority Report,"" I was bracing myself for topical nods toward the issue of genetic predisposition; it doesn't seem too unlikely that, half a century on, scientists will be capable of separating those members of the community destined for homicide from those whose DNA has programmed them to commit home baking instead. In the event, we get the Pre-Cognitives. They may sound like an angry British rock combo, but they are in fact three swimsuited human figures of mysterious origin who lie in a flotation tank and deliver their visions of upcoming horror, which are then transferred, or bootlegged, onto the screens of Precrime. In short, Spielberg is propping up his future with a relic of the past: the Pre-Cogs-notably the most intense of the trio, Agatha (Samantha Morton)-are just doing what the Oracle did at Delphi or the Sibyl at Cumae. What Spielberg gets from them, however, is the promise of suspense, and that is what he treasures most; this new"

The oppressiveness, of course, is intentional, but is it necessary? High-concept science-fiction escapades often try to impose new ways of seeing, but Spielberg seems intent on blistering our optic nerves. Like A.I., Minority Report is a movie in furious conflict with itself. Hope is pitted, rather unsuccessfully, against dystopia -- or is it dyspepsia? The result is one of the glummest and most forbidding thrillers ever. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, who runs the Justice Department's Precrime unit, which acts on evidence provided by three human ""Pre-cogs"" who float in a liquid suspension chamber and can see visions of future murders. The images they transmit are displayed in haphazard fragments on a giant screen before which Anderton stands like a maestro, sorting out the pictures with sweeping waves of his arms. The garish, fractured visuals may cause some in the audience to experience deja vu: Can it be that the Pre-cogs are channeling the credit sequence from Seven? The Precrime cops, tipped by the trio, swoop down and arrest potential murderers, who are contained in a comatose state in long pneumatic tubes while their misdeeds are played out before their eyes. The moral dilemma is that none of the convicted is actually guilty of anything in the present. But because the Pre-cogs are supposed to be infallible, and because the murder rate in Washington, D.C., for the past six years has dropped to zero, the public is enthusiastic, and there is a political initiative pending to make Precrime go national. Then comes the twist: Anderton is implicated in the murder, within 36 hours, of a man he doesn't even know. Believing himself innocent and set up by his enemies, he goes on the lam. Either he is a murderer-to-be or the Pre-cogs are wrong -- which would call into question everything Anderton stands for as a crime fighter. There are some extraordinary sequences in Minority Report, and they are almost always the ones in which Spielberg lets loose his genius for graphic movement. In one scene, Anderton jumps across lanes of magnetic-levitation cars that speed both horizontally and vertically through the automated cityscape. In the film's best set piece, he submerges himself in a bathtub while mechanical spiders try to identify him by scanning his retina. (The action is so astonishingly deft that the pop of a single air bubble caps the scene.) The futurist vision of a consumer society in Minority Report -- which was written by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen and very loosely based on a longish and dullish 1956 Philip K. Dick story -- is alarmingly plausible. By scanning our eyes, companies will track our whereabouts and personalize the hard sell as never before. Malls will be lined with talking billboards on a first-name basis with us. (This is the rare movie where the plethora of product placements actually serves a legitimate dramatic function.) And yet what's alarming to us may not be"

Tapping into the minds of the Pre-Cogs, a trio of psychics who can foresee the future, Precrime is able to track down and arrest would-be killers before they actually commit their lethal deeds. The system appears to be flawless. But when police chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), the head of this controversial department, is himself accused of the future murder of a man he hasn't even met, he sets out to prove his innocence, all the while hunted by his fellow officers. Based on a 1956 short story by renowned science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, Minority Report is typical of director Steven Spielberg in how it deftly melds flashy entertainment with critical issues. The movie is made up of three major ingredients: the thrilling action of an innocent man running from the law; the cautionary tale of how good intentions can go astray when not tempered by wisdom (specifically, infringing on people's civil liberties in the name of protecting them); and the old debate of human free will versus pre-ordained destiny. Unfortunately, the movie's philosophical elements take a backseat to John's mundane escape from authorities. Clearly, I understand that the relentless manhunt is more important than a bunch of metaphysical mumbo jumbo to most people. But without the pre-determined fate aspect, Minority Report is really nothing more than your standard crime drama, complete with cliches ranging from the generic framing of an innocent man to the corruption in the ranks of the police. I'm not asking for a stuffy dissertation that bores audiences like the sterile Solaris--just a comfortable balance that gives a little more substantial acknowledgement to the concept of being able to control one's own future. As it is, the film only briefly engages the notion of pre-determination intelligently when John debates Precrime issues with Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), an agent from the Justice Department who has been ordered to find flaws in the system. John's argument of an absolute future is just about the most interesting and thought-provoking moment of the whole movie, although the scene quickly gives way to nonsense that stretches even the boundaries of science fiction (a claim that the Pre-Cogs can only foresee homicides because ""there's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another"" puts an arbitrary importance on human lives). Credibility is further shot when the story dissolves into trite cheerleading that all but says, ""You can do it! You control your destiny! Go, John!"" Cruise's frequent failure to convey emotion makes his character of John Anderton less than interesting.

271,CYY_Doc1_Oblivion,CYY_Doc1_Oblivion,CYY,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"Since his questionable comments and ill advised sofasaults on Oprah, Tom Cruise has become an actor that many people love to hate. But those things are in the past and as wacky as they were they still didn't effect the level of his onscreen work. He's a talented actor who throughout his career has tackled a wide variety of roles in iconic 80's cheesefests, stirring and emotional dramas, big budgeted franchises, and even sci-fi thrillers. Now he returns to the science fiction genre in ""Oblivion"", a much more direct and vast sci-fi picture than Cruise's other efforts. ""Oblivion"" is co-written and directed by Joseph Kosinski, the man behind Disney's $400 million money maker ""Tron: Legacy"". Disney originally purchased the rights to ""Oblivion"" in hopes of repeating Tron's success but later relinquished the rights. It was quickly gobbled up by Universal Studios with Tom Cruise and Jessica Chastain set to star in the picture. Chastain would eventually drop out for ""Zero Dark Thirty"" with Olga Kurylenko replacing her. The movie is based on Kosinski's unpublished graphic novel and was given an ambitious $120 million budget. I have to say I was really excited for ""Oblivion"" even though the studio was very cryptic in regards to the film's details. That's a good approach to take because I found that the less you know going in the more effective the story will be. And for me it was quite effective. ""Oblivion"" doesn't fall into the category of a science fiction masterpiece but thanks to its visionary conception, stunning effects, and some strong committed performances it doesn't miss by much. Now there have been three main criticisms hurled at ""Oblivion"". Some have complained about its thin plot. Others took off points for its lack of originality. And yet others have had problems with the lack of any meaningful character development. I certainly don't flippantly dismiss any of these gripes but I don't necessarily agree with them either. There's a lot going on in ""Oblivion"" and while it does borrow from several other sci-fi pictures, the same could be said for most science fiction. As for the lack of character development, that may be true but I found there to be a good and needed reason for it. Like I said the less you know the better so I'm not going to spoil anything by divulging any significant details. The film is set in 2077 during the aftermath of a war with an alien species known as the Scavengers. The Scavs (as they're affectionally called) destroyed our moon which sent Earth into a series of natural and environmental convulsions. A full invasion of Earth followed. The humans won the war but the planet was left ravaged and in disrepair. The surviving population now inhabit one of Saturn's moons called Titan. Now if a sci-fi movie wants to score points with me just give me a futuristic world that's not only visually impressive but that I can get lost in. That certainly happened here and even"
272,CYY_Doc2_Oblivion,CYY_Doc2_Oblivion,CYY,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"""Oblivion"" is a competently made sci-fi action movie - something that can't be said about the majority of the genre. Though many of the prominent futurism themes can be linked back to earlier films, and a few loose ends might not be tied up with the sturdiest of knots, the structure and plot twists keep the intrigue high while the action paces itself nicely alongside the unfolding mystery. Tom Cruise makes a compelling hero and the setup is a savvy blend of dystopian invention and amnesia-induced identity loss. The list of films ""Oblivion"" borrows from is a long one, but the concepts are all executed cleverly and proficiently, resulting in an epic space opus that presents far more moments of awe than head-scratching queries. The year is 2077 and Earth has been left nearly uninhabitable after a brutal war against an invading alien species known as ""Scavengers."" While the remnants of humanity have been gathered aboard the Tet, an enormous pyramidal space station that will eventually carry the survivors to a new home on one of Saturn's moons, technician Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) remain on Earth to monitor and perform maintenance on giant hydro-rigs and the protective, heavily armed robot drones that guard them. When a spaceship crash-lands nearby and Jack investigates, he rescues from the wreckage Julia (Olga Kurylenko), a mysterious woman whose appearance sets into motion the discovery of a massive conspiracy that will place the very fate of mankind in Jack's hands. ""Oblivion"" is heady, weighty, and cerebral science-fiction, foregoing the little green man angle for a much more sinister and complex alien incursion. In terms of postapocalyptic, futuristic thrillers, borrowing randomly from ""The Road Warrior,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Moon,"" ""The Matrix"", and ""Total Recall,"" it's a highly ambitious and largely successful twist, toying with existential and deterministic viewpoints while smartly avoiding depressing bouts of violence or sacrifice. Its focus on altering or interfering with memories is augmented perfectly by the heavily synthesized soundtrack, itself lending to the dreamlike qualities of Jack's remembrances. An engaging mystery, ""Oblivion"" forces viewers to wait nearly two hours before giving up any secrets; but to the film's credit, the protracted anticipation is delightful. Mind-boggling and artistically visionary, the many answers it finally grapples with will probably raise further investigations into the various aspects less examined, but the climactic conclusion is pleasantly resolute - even if specific details can be rationalized with the term ""gaping plot holes."" An exemplary fit for IMAX screens, ""Oblivion"" boasts outstanding visuals that add tremendously to the scope of the project. Immense exterior shots and sets introduce the audience to a uniquely fascinating world, with unfriendly terrain, monumental wreckage, and obscured paradises. The interior designs are just as spectacular, though used much more sparingly. The obvious budget for special effects definitely helps establish and stabilize the pioneering perspective; visual wizardry occasionally substitutes for inchoate plot points. But perhaps most impressive of all is the origins of the story, starting as"
273,CYY_Doc3_Oblivion,CYY_Doc3_Oblivion,CYY,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"Oblivion is familiar territory, both for Cruise and for the science fiction genre. It unquestionably remains devoted first and foremost to delivering stylish visuals and gorgeous imagery, yet unlike Tron: Legacy's emptiness, second-time feature director Joseph Kosinski laces the world he's built with ideas. Granted, we've seen these ideas elsewhere, but in an era so hellbent on catering an absence of actual philosophy in its biggest budget studio fare, I found myself grateful that Oblivion didn't merely find inspiration in plot points from better sci-fi stories, but also in their themes. While many moments will likely provide deja vu, I didn't find the film derivative in a negative sense, but in a literal sense: the word derive comes from the Latin derivare, to draw off, as if from a stream. Oblivion draws its samples from the best sources available- in a film whose first frame is a memory, it uses its familiarity to us to its advantage. It's like making a sandwich the way your mom used to make them, achieving sense memory of past pleasures. For a film set in the future and chock to the brim with special effects, it's surprisingly old-fashioned. Jack (Tom Cruise) is the Wall-E of 2077. When invaders destroy our moon- an impressively gorgeous effect, always immaculately framed in the background of nighttime sequences- Earth is effectively ruined, thanks to tsunamis and earthquakes. Humanity successfully wins the war against the invaders, but Earth is no longer habitable. Luckily, we find a safe home away from home in Titan, one of Saturn's moons. Traveling to Titan takes energy, so we develop a means of converting our ocean water into energy. Some invaders remaining on Earth attempting to disrupt this process, so a huge space station called the Tet controls a hefty number of drones which patrol the Earth hunting down our opponents who mean us harm. Jack and his lover Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are stationed high above Earth to serve as repairmen for the drones. Yet since Jack experiences memories from sixty years ago, memories he couldn't possibly have, we know from the beginning that this idyllic simplistic life he leads contains secrets stashed below the surface. It's impossible to delve into the particulars of the story without spoiling what unfolds, but as the posters reveal, Morgan Freeman shows up, given the type of outstanding entrance shot that is destined to be at the top of his Lifetime Achievement Oscar montage one day. In his first film, Kosinski showed a gift for creating impressive pictures that aspire to be iconic- here, he improves upon his initial efforts, using his images to flesh out the characters and tell the story in a way he didn't seem to fully comprehend last time at bat. The best shots are stored in the brain more effectively this time around: Freeman's entrance, a memory of the Empire State Building, a nude swim in a glass pool, a descent into a spooky old library, and a certain fight sequence that pits"

The mystery is the thing, and when that disappears, the appeal goes with it. There needs to be more than mystery for a movie to hold up until the end. To be fair, the best moments of ""Oblivion,"" from co-writer/director Joseph Kosinski (""Tron: Legacy""), based on his own, unpublished graphic novel, occur in its first half, as it introduces its future world -- the Earth of 2077, more than a half-century after a war with aliens known as Scavengers, or Scavs, left it uninhabitable, forcing its inhabitants to flee to Titan, Saturn's largest moon. A lone couple (Tom Cruise, Andrea Riseborough) lives in a sleek tower high above the ruins of New York City, finishing a five-year mission maintaining the machines harvesting the planet's water for conversion into energy. Two weeks and they're off to join the others on Titan. (If you think that seems like a tall order for two people, stay with it; it'll make sense.) Victoria (Riseborough) is content to do her job, asking no questions and dutifully reporting to her commander, Sally (Melissa Leo). Everything seems to be going according to plan, but something appears to be -- off. Sally is just a bit too pleasant, Victoria and Jack's (Cruise) relationship a little too idyllic. Jack is haunted by dreams of a woman -- dreams that feel more like memories, only he and Victoria supposedly had their memories wiped before starting their assignment. He explores the planet when he can, collecting books and other items he comes across -- he's even built himself a nice little cabin with a basketball hoop. When a ship crashes to the surface, Jack is astonished to find the only survivor is Julia (Olga Kurylenko), literally the woman of his dreams. His already questioning mind needs answers, especially after he finds there are others, led by Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman), still living on the planet. After Kosinski, who shares the screenplay credit with two others, takes his time building and exploring his world, several revelations roll out in succession, the movie changing with each one but never becoming less than compelling. I will leave the big surprises for you to discover and enjoy on your own. Visually, the movie is a marvel, the ravaged Earth in stark contrast to Jack and Victoria's high-tech living quarters dominated by whites and stainless steel. And it's brought to life by Claudio Miranda's (an Oscar winner for ""Life of Pi"") striking cinematography. Though it ultimately comes down to flying bullets and blowing things up, Kosinski, like the creators of all the best science fiction, has a little more on his mind, namely the concept of identity and how it is created and defined, and he uses Cruise's tendency to be a bit of a blank slate to his advantage as he plays with this idea. While not nearly as ponderous as, say ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Oblivion"" is not the slam-bang"
275,CYY_Doc5_Oblivion,CYY_Doc5_Oblivion,CYY,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"I went into OBLIVION with that in mind, and I honestly wasn't expecting much beyond a fun ride with some good eye candy. To my surprise, I actually got a lot more than that, with OBLIVION being an ambitious film on more than just a visual level. To be fair to the critics that haven't been too keen on it, Kosinski's film is far more successful visually than it is narratively, but even still, it tries to be something more than your typical sci-fi programmer, and for the most part I think it succeeds. OBLIVION is certainly a more cerebral sci-fi movie than the trailers would have you believe, and it definitely feels like a throwback to the kind of pre-STAR WARS sci-fi of the sixties and seventies. In that regard, it would probably make an interesting double bill with MOON, as they seem to be inspired by a lot of the same movies, like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, THX 1138, and SILENT RUNNING. Like his last film, TRON: LEGACY, Kosinski's OBLIVION benefits tremendously from an arresting mix of visuals and music. The cool, sterile whites of Jack and Victoria's sanctuary are an interesting contrast to the vast open spaces of a ravaged earth, and the shots juxtaposing Cruise against the empty landscape are gorgeous. If you have the opportunity to watch OBLIVION on an IMAX screen, I'd wager this is one movie that's really worth the extra expense. It's all complemented by a stunning musical score by French electronica band M83 and co-composer Joseph Trapanese (who also worked with Daft Punk on their TRON:LEGACY score). If you know M83's work (""Hurry Up, We're Dreaming"" is a great album), you'll expect the gorgeous electronic soundscapes we get throughout, although the score is never overwhelming, and can be effectively subtle when needed. It's the perfect complement to what's happening on-screen, and some of the cues, such as the track ""Starwaves"" (which plays during a love scene), are absolutely superb. That said, everyone, even the critics that don't like OBLIVION, have agreed that the visuals and the score are perfect. How does the rest of the film fare? Here's where I differ with a lot of the critics. The story- which I can't really go into too much detail about here without giving away spoilers- actually worked quite well for me. Jack's solitary journey felt like something out of a cool episode of THE OUTER LIMITS, and I really liked the big twist in the movie's third act that seemed to put a lot of people off. The key to its working for me is probably Tom Cruise's performance. With someone else in the lead, OBLIVION probably wouldn't have worked as well, but Cruise, who always brings sincerity to his parts, really nails it. Jack- having had his memory wiped- has no life but his work repairing drones on Earth. His sexual relationship with Riseborough's cool and efficient Victoria is a nice perk, but even this seems like something of a necessity,"
276,CYY_Doc6_Oblivion,CYY_Doc6_Oblivion,CYY,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"It takes more than an hour for Oblivion to become whatever it is the filmmakers think it's supposed to be. But when that whatever arrives (and even before it does) the movie works as an experience that glorifies the megaplex ideal. I watched it in a very good IMAX theater in suburban Philadelphia that, like all IMAX theaters, had a guardrail sitting at the bottom of the screen. It seemed to be there expressly to prevent you from entering one of Tom Cruise's pores. Fully overwhelmed in IMAX might be the only way to watch this movie. It's been shot with a crispness that elevates the heart rate. Projected at that scale, you want to leave your seat and explore this postnuclear Earth, to walk the film's sands and marvel at the manner in which the geological table has been so fantastically upended that Manhattan erodes beneath dunes and decays at the base of canyons. (The year is 2073.) Oblivion oscillates between sites that are way up high and locations that are way down low, between the astral dark of outer space and the flashlit dankness of long-abandoned caves. Even at IMAX scale it remains thrillingly impossible to detect whether the orb-like drones that accompany Jack Harper, the wistful repairman Cruise plays, have true tactility or whether they're just projections from a hard drive. The drones perform surveillance, they're armed to the teeth, and their resemblance to eyeballs is a clever formal manifestation of their function, which is to hunt and exterminate aliens for an ominous entity called the Tet, whose twangy operations commander, Sally, is played by a scratchy video uplink of Melissa Leo. The orbs have a rapport with Jack that gives you that Blade Runner replicant feeling about him. They break; he fixes them. When Jack and, by extension, the orbs happen upon a tiny survivalist civilization of human rebels - they're the ""aliens,"" and they're called Scavs - the orbs descend and instigate a fantastic firefight. Tremendous care has gone into making you believe that the orbs are whizzing around, flying into beams, and machine-gunning everyone. No matter its actual provenance, this ruined and depopulated Earth often feels breathtakingly real. But there's too much time to realize that what Oblivion cares about most is how good it looks. The director and cowriter Joseph Kosinski is a trained architect and visual-effects designer who wrote the graphic novel that became this movie. His expertise is in vastness and scale. He knows how to fill the camera frame and can orchestrate chaos and elaborate movement so that your ability to follow it is simple and your nervous system's response to its intensity is involuntary. His meticulousness is as painstaking as it was in Tron: Legacy, another grand optical illusion that kept confusing commercial vanity with philosophical wonder. There he made light something you want to lick and wear and put inside you. Oblivion is something you want to be inside of. Upon entry, you'd have plenty of room to"
277,CYY_Doc7_Oblivion,CYY_Doc7_Oblivion,CYY,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"Earth, 2077. Sixty years earlier, alien invaders had blown up our moon, and an intergalactic battle ensued. ""We won the war but lost the planet,"" says Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), a kind of grease-monkey pilot whose job is to repair the drones that monitor desolate Earth while the rest of humanity lives in a remote space station. His coworker and assigned girlfriend Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) directs Jack's flying sorties over the wreckage of Manhattan, which may literally be a no-man's land. Yet as he lies in bed with Victoria, Jack has visions of another, mysterious woman (Olga Kurylenko), from his fantasies or his past. ""I know you, but we've never met. I'm with you and I don't know your name. I know I'm dreaming, but it feels like more that. It feels like a memory. How can that be?"" And how is it that science-fiction films imagine the worst for our future while steeped in love-loss for our past? Perhaps because the genre blossomed, as literature and then cinema, in the late 1940s - the time of the Cold War and the first nuclear age - when our world's two great powers played a deadly game of mutually assured destruction, and when fearing the prospect of human extinction was not paranoia, just common sense. It's no wonder that any time before the Bomb seemed Edenic to sci-fi writers, readers and moviegoers; any time after might spell The End. The same warm ache of nostalgia envelops the Jack of 2077, the hero of Joseph Kosinski's oh-so-serious Oblivion, for the pre-invasion Earth of 2017. He stands at the top of the Empire State Building, most of it covered in sand and rubble, wanders through the caverns of the New York Public Library on 42nd Street (only eight blocks away from King Kong's final perch but miraculously not buried) and patrols Yankee Stadium, scene of the very last World Series. He saves old books, a catcher's mitt and baseball and some LPs from the 1960s and '70s; Procol Harum keeps playing on his internal iTunes. Fixating on the 1948 Andrew Wyeth painting Christina's World, and on his dream girl, Jack finds a verdant interior life in this wasteland by mixing memory and desire. His poetic guide, though, is not Eliot but Macaulay, whose famous couplet in The Lays of Ancient Rome - ""And how can man die better than facing fearful odds, / For the ashes of his fathers, and the temples of his Gods..."" - haunts Jack like a long-ago pop tune or a distant battle cry. Oblivion must be the only science-fiction film that borrows substantially from I Am Legend, WALL-E and Sleepless in Seattle - itself a remake of 1957's An Affair to Remember, which was a remake of 1939's Love Affair. In fact, everything in this movie keeps looking backward. Victoria warns Jack that ""Our job is to not remember. Remember?"" That's the cue for this company man with a rebellious streak to find his future in the past,"
278,CYY_Doc8_Oblivion,CYY_Doc8_Oblivion,CYY,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"Joseph Kosinski's Oblivion is really no more derivative a science fiction thriller than most these days, it just has the unfortunate tendency of seeming to be more obvious about it. Although he originally conceived of it as a graphic novel in the late 2000s, Kosinski has managed to transform his story about clean-up workers maintaining drones on the decimated surface of Earth into a mega-budget cinematic spectacle, replete with big effects and the presence of Tom Cruise. The story is assembled out of bits and pieces of sci-fi lore, which isn't a problem in and of itself. The genre is, like most well-worn modes of storytelling, inherently cannibalistic, and the real test is how well the storyteller puts the familiar pieces together. Oblivion is both a success and a failure in this regard, as it manages to maintain interest despite overt familiarity in virtually all areas, although its primary achievement is keeping some degree of mystery despite a marketing campaign that gives away one of the film's best twists. Cruise, in his first sci-fi outing since Spielberg's traumatic blockbusters Minority Report (2002) and War of the Worlds (2005), plays a man named Jack who, along with a woman named Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are the only human beings on Earth after a rogue alien race known as Scavengers (""Scavs"" for short) destroyed the moon, throwing the planet into chaos of earthquakes and tidal waves before their actual invasion. Humankind finally turned to nuclear weapons as the only line of defense, which won the war, but left the planet largely uninhabitable. The surviving members of the human race have fled to one of the moons of Jupiter, while a few others have remained on a massive space station orbiting the planet. Jack, who does the physical work, and Victoria, who acts as a communications officer, are responsible for maintaining the technologies that have been put in place to make Earth habitable again, namely giant transformers that use sea water to heal the atmosphere and weaponized drones that patrol the planet and kill off any remaining Scavs that might threaten the endeavor. Of course, as the old saying goes, not everything is at it seems, as the purpose of Jack and Victoria's mission is called into question by that plot twist that the trailer gives away. Pretty soon, Jack is questioning not only what he's doing there, but who he is, thus merging the genre's tendency toward both conspiracy theories and identity crises. Part of the plot turns on the crashing of another ship that contains a woman named Julia (Olga Kurylenko), whose presence undercuts the stability of Jack and Victoria's daily routines (in addition to being co-workers, they are also lovers). To say much more would risk ruining what secrets the film does hold, although savvy viewers will probably have it figured out pretty quickly, which saps the film of much of its intrigue. Kosinski, whose feature debut was the visually stunning, but narratively muddy Tron: Legacy (2010), proves once again that"

Tom Cruise usually exerts a good amount of quality control over his projects and has for decades now. When he takes a starring role, he comes on as producer (often hiring the director) and is very involved from tip to tail in the entire creative process. In short, all you need to do is look at his track record to see that he works really hard to make sure his movies are, at the least, entertaining/thrilling to a wide audience. That's part of the reason why Oblivion, his newest big-budget, sci-fi adventure movie, is such a disappointment. Writer/director Joseph Kosinski wrote what would become Oblivion eight years ago. In the meantime, he directed tons of TV commercials and became familiar with CGI special effects. This led to his feature-film debut Tron Legacy for Disney and now this. Lensed by Oscar-winning cinematographer Claudio Miranda, Oblivion looks stunning, especially in IMAX. It has an epic scope, as Cruise and his teammate/girlfriend Andrea Riseborough watch over a fleet of drones and mining machines tasked with draining the Earth of its resources after an alien invasion devastated the planet. They work in a station mounted impossibly high above the clouds and are nearing the end of their mission and looking forward to joining the rest of the human survivors on one of Saturn's moons. Starting with a ""mandatory memory wipe"" and the dream sequences Cruise's character is plagued with, we know something is horribly wrong about this premise, but Oblivion never amps up the dread factor. Instead, it leads the audience along with incredibly obvious clues so that by the time it starts revealing it's ""twists,"" we are way ahead of it. (Blame the spoiler-heavy marketing, too.) But plot holes and mismanagement of suspense aside, ""Oblivion"" fails because it establishes an interesting premise and then abandons its characters as soon as things get complicated in favor of a typical ""save the world""-type action story. If Kosinski really wanted to make a sci-fi movie in the spirit of early classics like Chris Marker's La Jetee and Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris as he has mentioned, then he should have engaged more fully with his characters' personal crises and not added Morgan Freeman and Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau to muddle things up, brooding around in ""Matrix""-like outfits with capes and making big, dumb speeches. Oblivion isn't a total loss, but it is disappointing not only to see the film abandon the interesting sci-fi issues around its central love triangle (Olga Kurylenko plays a woman meant to be mysterious but, again, it's painfully obvious from the outset who she is) but also see it devolve into a series of hackneyed action-movie cliches, including some really insulting third-act dialogue. It would be interesting to find out if Tom Cruise's role as producer"

Oblivion is like that movie-within-a-movie: Everything in it feels 100 percent inauthentic. That vibe, as it happens, turns out to be intentional. But when the humans arrive, it's still a narcotic. The pity is that the film is about the war to liberate the human spirit from alien soul-snuffing exploiters and that Cruise is supposed to be our last best hope. In the long opening voice-over, his character, Jack (not Reacher), explains that ""Scavengers"" obliterated humankind: They blew up the moon and Nature did the rest. Humans beat the invaders back and then took off en masse to colonize a moon of Saturn, Titan. But a few people stayed behind to harvest the remaining resources and watch out for leftover ""Scavs."" Jack is teamed with a Brit named Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), who sits in a giant mushroom like flight tower reading data from ""hydro rigs"" and lethal drones. He flies around doing repairs and calling in those drones whenever there are signs of saboteurs. He also tells us that his memory has been wiped so that he won't spill any beans if grabbed by Scavs. Director Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) thinks big - big white impersonal settings on a big barren landscape under a big fractured moon with one big segment broken off and simply hanging, suspended in orbit, with a trail of little pieces floating around. But the sets just sit there. The first half-hour is Jack talking to Victoria on his headset, Jack fixing rigs, and Jack having sex with the eager-beaver Victoria. (Wow, does she want him.) They talk longingly of their imminent departure for Titan. Victoria speaks to an administrator on a screen called Sally (Melissa Leo). These scenes exert a strange fascination: They're so conscientiously neutral, so droningly dull that they almost pass for Stanley Kubrick-like. But Jack shares our boredom. He feels dislocated. He has visions of himself atop the Empire State Building with another woman - someone more compelling than his vaguely robotic partner. Someone played by Olga Kurylenko, this year's comely avatar of spirituality. When Jack finds a crashed spaceship with human passengers (including Olga) in suspended animation and a drone flies in and starts blasting them, he's flummoxed. Drones are supposed to kill Scavs, not humans! And certainly not Olga! Eventually, Jack is captured by beings who look like humans (but you never know), led by Morgan Freeman, who puffs happily on a cigar - and you would, too, if you had to do as little for a paycheck this size. He says he was intrigued when Jack found a book with a poem by Macaulay in which three Romans sacrifice themselves to save their city. That's when things get murky.

Bad guy Bane - the bane of all our existence, as played by Tom Hardy in a mouth guard that'll give fanboys orthodontist nightmares - has his anti-government rhetoric down so pat, he can make a new Bastille Day sound vaguely reasonable. And his diabolical plans for Gotham mix other specifically Dickensian horrors with modernist ones: people's courts straight out of A Tale of Two Cities, a surveillance society on steroids, even underground tremors that will stoke fracking fears. All of it set not in the stylized Gotham of the previous movies, but in a gritty, post-Sept. 11 Manhattan, complete with a still-under-construction tower at Ground Zero. Quite a setting for super-sized superheroics. I saw the film in 35 millimeter and did not feel deprived, though I'll certainly be heading back to catch it in IMAX at some point. Even without an image five stories tall, the spectacle is considerable, pumped up by a Hans Zimmer score so thundering that it pretty much drowns out the dialogue in some spots.

So much so that, its considerable 2-hour, 44-minute length notwithstanding, as soon as it's over, all you want to do is see it all over again. That desire comes despite - or perhaps because of - the fact that ""The Dark Knight Rises"" might be the bleakest, most despairing superhero film ever made. It uses a wholly terrifying villain to emphasize the physical vulnerability of a hero we sometimes forget is no more than human. And it underscores the black moods and sense of dark destiny that have always clustered around the psyche of billionaire Bruce Wayne and his somber compulsion to fight crime.

Sharing the screenwriting credit with his brother Jonathan and story credit with David S. Goyer, Nolan has woven characters and themes from both of his previous Batman films into ""Dark Knight Rises."" Returning regulars include Michael Caine as loyal retainer Alfred, Morgan Freeman as Wayne Industries executive Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman as Gotham's ever-conflicted Commissioner Gordon. New to Gotham, but not to Nolan's films, is a trio of ""Inception""stars: Tom Hardy, who put on 30 pounds to play the physically daunting epitome of evil known as Bane; Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who brings welcome texture to the role of the idealistic Gotham cop John Blake; and Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate, one of the more attractive members of the board of Wayne Industries. With the further addition of Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, a slinky second-story operative, this Batman film boasts the most accomplished female acting of the trilogy. Also, and almost unheard of in a superhero context, ""Dark Knight Rises"" brings a whiff of contemporary societal trends - or what Nolan has called ""the things that worry us these days"" - into play. His film coolly mocks the pieties of both the right and the left, starting with a jaundiced look at how law and order-obsessed societies start to rot from the inside when they are based on lies. The lies that begin ""The Dark Knight Rises"" are the ones that ended the previous film: that Gotham district attorney Harvey Dent was a crime-fighting hero who inspired the tough-on-crime Dent Act rather than a psychotic vigilante called Two-Face, and that Batman is a heartless thug rather than the hero who saved the city one more time. Understandably distraught by this turn of events (though they were his own self-sacrificing idea), Bruce Wayne has become a tortured recluse who walks with a limp and is so morose he's grown a goatee. And he's had"

Stately and just serious enough, ""Batman Begins"" was trumped by Nolan's own 2008 sequel, ""The Dark Knight,"" which channeled a planet's worth of post-9/11 panic and pitted Christian Bale's masked vigilante against Heath Ledger's unforgettable merry psycho. Despite a cool billion at the worldwide box office, that film, like any studio machine worth its salt, was not for everyone. The atmosphere of grim, free-floating dread, along with Nolan's grandiosity and his occasionally flat-footed way with a complicated action sequence, tipped the experience into ""not much fun"" for some. Not for me. For me, ""The Dark Knight"" was a memorable death cackle and a striking vision of Gotham City, that familiar dream metropolis on which all our worst fears as law-abiding citizens are continually enacted, on the brink of annihilating chaos. It felt right - exploitive but shrewdly so - for the unraveling times. Now comes ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" which makes ""The Dark Knight"" look like ""Dora the Explorer"" and is more of a 164-minute anxiety disorder than a movie. Nolan's third in the planned trilogy will likely satisfy many who fell headlong into the previous two. The new film works on your nervous system the way composer Hans Zimmer's kettle drums of doom keeps tightening the screws, long after the screws are tight. There are many things to admire in ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" and Nolan's bombast is a far, far higher grade than you'd find in a ""Transformers"" movie. But nothing in the new film, which turns Gotham over to the masked terrorist Bane, played by an occasionally intelligible Tom Hardy, meets or exceeds the crises of ""The Dark Knight,"" especially that picture's ferry-boat sequence, where Gotham's residents found themselves in a no-win situation and somehow won anyway. Nolan's notion of amping up the evildoing in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is to simply layer the slaughter in higher and higher piles, though with a refreshing lack of computer-generated imagery. There's plenty of that too, once bridges start blowing up and Gotham's 3,000 police officers (a figure apparently referencing the 9/11 victims) are trapped underground while Bane goes crazy above ground. But at least Nolan shoots on film, and didn't release ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in 3-D. Who needs an anxiety disorder on an IMAX screen and in 3-D? The film picks up eight years after Wayne, taking the rap for the murder of district attorney Harvey Dent, has slunk into exile, with only Michael Caine's Alfred around for company. Gotham has won the war on organized crime, smeary-clown-makeup division. But a nerve-racking alum of the League of Shadows has taken the Joker's place, and this barely human bull, Bane,"
284,GRY_Doc4_TheDarkKnightRises,GRY_Doc4_TheDarkKnightRises,GRY,Action,Positive,The Dark Knight Rises,"Early in ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" director Christopher Nolan's epic conclusion to his Batman trilogy, the ever-loyal Alfred Pennyworth confronts a crippled, withdrawn Bruce Wayne, who has been living like a recluse in Wayne Manor since he gave up the Bat cape eight years earlier. ""You're not living,"" Pennyworth says, emotionally. ""You're just waiting for something bad to happen."" Then something bad - very, very bad - does happen in the form of the brutal Bane, who has come to a peaceful Gotham City to lead his own devious, evil version of the Occupy movement, a revolution against the city's wealthy and powerful. Oh, and he's brought a whole army of thugs and mercenaries with him. Pennyworth's worst fear comes true: The Batman will return to the streets for what, given the power of Bane, may be his last battle. Make no mistake about it, ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is a spectacular show. The visuals are extraordinary. The action sequences are dazzling, especially so since Nolan uses very little CGI, relying instead on old-fashioned stunt work. It will be hard to shake some of the images, whether it's the stunning midair plane hijacking that opens the film, Batman tooling through Gotham on his cool toys or Bane blowing up a stadium during an NFL game. But the real power of this final chapter is just how intelligently it melds references to, and commentary on, modern concerns while staying true to its comic-book roots and including touches fanboys love, such as the addition of Selina Kyle (the Catwoman, although she's never called that) to the cast of characters. Nolan and his brother Jonathan, a frequent collaborator, have written an audacious take on the Batman myth that draws from elements of Frank Miller's 1986 graphic novel, ""Dark Knight,"" and from the Bane-driven ""Knightfall"" series from the mid-1990s, without copying them. They touch on real-world fears such as terrorism, collapsing economies and domestic extremism. Underlying the whole script is the greatest terror of all: that, someday, everything in our lives will spin completely out of control. ""There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne,"" Kyle purrs at one point. ""You and your friends better batten down the hatches, 'cause when it hits, you're gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us."" To lay out the storyline in detail dances on the edge of spoiler, given the significant number of twists, turns and surprises Nolan tosses in. He never cheats; he includes enough clues as to what's happening that nothing really comes completely out of left field. While there is no performance here quite as wondrous as the late Heath Ledger's as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" the cast's work is sterling, from the big roles to the smallest. Christian Bale was fine as the Batman in the first two films, but he is even better here, adding nuance and shading that was absent before. Anne Hathaway provides some much needed zest and"

The police are helpless as they pursue the miscreants into a tunnel. Suddenly, the tunnel goes dark. A familiar vehicle with monster-truck wheels, driven by a man in black cape and cowl, has joined the chase. Batman is back. An older cop observes the action, smiles and says to a rookie, ""Boy, you're in for a show tonight, son."" The Dark Knight Rises (TDKR), Christopher Nolan's mesmerizing climax to his trilogy reboot of the DC Comics character, is a show, all right. But not in the way of the standard summer action fantasy. Although his movie contains elaborate fights, stunts, chases and war toys, and though the director dresses half his characters in outfits suitable for a Comic-Con revel, Nolan is a dead-serious artist with a worldview many shades darker than the knight of the title. The Avengers is kid stuff compared with this meditation on mortal loss and heroic frailty. For once a melodrama with pulp origins convinces viewers that it can be the modern equivalent to Greek myths or a Jonathan Swift satire. TDKR is that big, that bitter - a film of grand ambitions and epic achievement. The most eagerly anticipated movie of summer 2012 was worth waiting for. Reuniting the core crew from his 2005 Batman Begins and the 2008 The Dark Knight - Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Michael Caine as his butler Alfred, Gary Oldman as police commissioner Jim Gordon and Morgan Freeman as the entrepreneur Lucius Fox - Nolan has created new roles for four of the actors from his 2010 hit Inception. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the resourceful cop John Blake; Tom Hardy is Bane, the monster who would bring Gotham to its knees; Marion Cotillard is the philanthropist Miranda Tate; Cillian Murphy, who also played the Scarecrow in Batman Begins, returns as a hanging judge as the city explodes in chaos. And Anne Hathaway creeps in and out as Selina Kyle, a.k.a. Catwoman. Eight years after he dispatched the Joker (Heath Ledger) and took the rap for killing Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), the idealistic district attorney who had become the villainous Two-Face, Bruce lives morose and secluded in Wayne Manor, seen only by Alfred. Gotham appears at peace, with no organized crime surfacing. By there's at least one gifted solo artist. Selina, in maid's garb, manages to pick Bruce's private safe, making off with his fingerprints and a necklace she has the gall and style to wear. The theft stirs Bruce out of his torpor, and he shows up at a charity ball hosted by Miranda. Selina, momentarily Bruce's dance partner, tells him, ""There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, cause when it hits you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us.""

286,GRY_Doc6_TheDarkKnightRises,GRY_Doc6_TheDarkKnightRises,GRY,Action,Negative,The Dark Knight Rises,"With The Dark Knight Rises, Christopher Nolan brings to a close the most ambitious cycle of superhero films ever made. Here, as in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, he explores both the consequences of doing nothing in a lawless world and the consequences of doing the right thing (fighting crime) for the wrong reason (personal revenge). He muses on the mask as a source of power over others - and a source of havoc on one's own identity. Implicitly, he asks whether justice can be attained in a society that strives to balance the desire for order with the rights of the individual. Whatever else The Dark Knight Rises is or isn't, it's big - very big. It's also very long, closing in on three hours with not a lot of Batman to show for it but plenty of Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne dragging his broken body around and looking sad while people make speeches at him. The Dark Knight rises - for maybe fifteen minutes, then gets knocked on his ass again. Of course, it's not as if Nolan fans (Nolanoids) have anywhere else to go. They'll resent having to give up their seats. The movie opens with Wayne a bearded recluse, still in mourning for the woman he thought loved him (he'll soon find out she loved another), his superhero persona dormant. The dark knight is a fugitive now. Eight years earlier, he became a martyr in the cause of justice, taking the blame for the murder of district attorney turned mad avenger Harvey ""Two Face"" Dent to protect Dent's law-and-order reputation. That seems to have worked like, well, gangbusters. Under the ""Dent Act,"" thousands of gangland types rot behind bars while at least one segment of Gotham City - the one percent- lives high on the hog. Beneath them, however, in the sewers, apocalyptic forces amass, led by the masked muscleman Bane (Tom Hardy), who wears a sort of black-mandibled breathing apparatus that makes him sound like a cross between Darth Vader, Andy Kaufman's Foreign Man, and someone trying to sing ""Nessun Dorma"" while choking to death on a mouthful of muesli. In the prologue, Bane impressively commandeers a plane, kills several CIA agents, and kidnaps a man for reasons I almost but didn't quite catch. (It would help to be able to read his lips, but he has none.) Then Bane pretends to be a modern French Revolutionary type, smashing up the Stock Exchange and exhorting the people of Gotham City (once he has effectively imprisoned them) to seize the assets of the wealthy and redistribute them. Master thief Selina Kyle, a.k.a. the Catwoman (Anne Hathaway), makes a lot of class-warfare noises, too. (""There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.

So now we have the full saga of our hero, from childhood trauma to grand apotheosis. We see how Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), the compulsive loner and eccentric billionaire, has transformed himself into Batman, the scourge of evil and savior of Gotham City. At last, we are able to grasp what links these two incarnations: each, it turns out, is a pain in the neck. Be honest. How badly would you not want Bruce-or Batman-to show up at one of your parties? He has no small talk (and Bale, as an actor, has charisma but no charm), although ask him about fear, anger, and other large abstract nouns, especially as they relate to him, and he'll keep you in the corner all night. He doesn't eat or drink, besides toying with a flute of champagne. Basic human tasks are beyond his reach; direct Batman to the bathroom, and it would take him twenty minutes of hydraulic shunting simply to unzip. On the rare occasions when Bruce, fresh from his helicopter or his Lamborghini, enters a reception with a girl or two on his arm, he looks deeply uncomfortable, and Nolan, as if sharing that unease, tends to hurry him through the moment. The point-and, after three installments, it seems a fatal one-is that the two halves of our hero form not a beguiling contrast but a dreary, perfect match. Both as Wayne and as super-Wayne he seems indifferent, as the films themselves are, to the activities of little people, and to the claims of the everyday, preferring to semi-purse his lips, as if preparing to whistle for an errant dog, and stare pensively into the distance. Caped or uncaped, the guy is a bore. He should have kids; that would pull him out of himself. Or else he should hang out with Iron Man and get wasted. He should have fun. The third film picks up where its predecessors left off, the implication being that anyone unschooled in those two works is not worthy, and not welcome. ""I knew Harvey Dent,"" Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) says, in the opening scene, and if you murmur, ""Harvey who?,"" it's time to bail. Harvey Dent, in ""The Dark Knight,"" was a good man turned bad, the district attorney who cleaned up Gotham City but sullied his soul; Gordon is the good cop who stayed good, his mustache and glasses, like Groucho's, unchanged with the passing years. Newcomers include Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), another pure policeman, and Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard), a businesswoman with a past even more loaded than her wallet; regulars include Alfred (Michael Caine), the butler-cum-pedagogue who has always dwelt by Bruce's side, and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), who does pretty much what Q does in the Bond movies, except that he does it with the air of someone offering up pieces of the True"

Fans have been clamoring for it; the media are all over it; a record-breaking opening week is practically guaranteed. I only wish I could say I enjoyed this big, sprawling beast of a movie. Don't get me wrong - I think Nolan is one of Hollywood's best and brightest, and the previous two Batman films set a high bar. In an era dominated by spectacle, fantasy and escapism, when apparently all the audience really wants or needs is the excuse to switch off and chill out, ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" supplied all that and still somehow reflected the anxieties and tensions of America in the post 9/11 world. No other blockbusters have been so overtly fixated on terrorism - wanton destruction for destruction's sake - and the price to be paid for responding in kind. If fans care more passionately about ""The Dark Knight"" than the more lighthearted and frankly enjoyable Marvel movies, it's surely because there's more here than meets the eye. The 9/11 subtext is more explicit than ever here, with masked bogeyman Bane (Tom Hardy) wreaking havoc on the Stock Exchange and threatening to blow Gotham sky-high. He may not wear the beard of the jihadist, but the (literal) hellhole he comes from sure looks like it belongs in Afghanistan. And while he speaks via a voice box in a plumy English accent that might be an imitation of Sir Ian McKellen doing Patrick Stewart, his revolutionary rhetoric echoes nihilistic terrorists. If Bane has a goal, it's to bomb Gotham back to year zero. This is eight years after Bruce Wayne has lost his beloved Rachel and Batman disappeared from view, taking the rap for killing civic hero Harvey Dent. Wayne is a recluse, somewhere between Jay Gatsby and Howard Hughes in the public imagination, never venturing out into the world until cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) picks his lock and piques his fancy. She's no Joker (who is?), but Hathaway's slinky, light-fingered, high-kicking thief is the film's best idea of fun, even if she's also weighed down with the Nolan brothers' irrepressible urge to smuggle topical, half-baked Occupy sermons into the script (as others have noted, the movie's defense of the establishment in the form of philanthropic billionaires and an incorruptible police force gives it a conservative gloss and makes you wonder what on earth Nolan saw in the two films he's cited as inspirations, ""The Battle of Algiers"" and ""Prince of the City"").

Martinson's fondly remembered 'campy' Batman film (1966) finds the po-faced caped crusader (Adam West) running about the Gotham waterfront in broad daylight with a giant fizzing cartoon-infernal device. The hero is repeatedly thwarted in his attempts to throw it in the water before it explodes by young lovers, passing nuns or innocent tweeting birds. ""Some days,"" West deadpans, ""you just can't get rid of a bomb."" Christopher Nolan's Bat-films, which now form a complete trilogy, are about as far in approach as possible from the jokey pop-art tone of the 1960s TV series that spun off that film. However, the whole climax of this epic-length instalment - which plays on a heroic scale, with soaring Hans Zimmer music and floods of tears - turns out to be a variation on that same situation, with a much bigger bomb and the whole of Gotham City in peril. Needless to say, we are a world away from shark-repellent bat-spray, but the strength of the Batman franchise in all its many forms - from the character's introduction in Detective Comics in 1939 through to the computer game Arkham City last year - is that the set-up is open to all manner of legitimate, workable approaches. Following Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008), The Dark Knight Rises has to pick up plot threads from the earlier films. The late Heath Ledger's Joker goes unmentioned, but every other old foe or threat is present in some form, and we see the toll they have taken on Christian Bale's limping, grey-streaked Bruce Wayne, who has become a Howard Hughes-like recluse, to the exasperation of Michael Caine's slightly hectoring Alfred. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), aka Two-Face, is now remembered as a false hero whose atrocities have been covered up in order to justify what sound like swingeing anti-crime laws ('the Dent Act'), which have put an end to the criminal empires featured in the earlier films. The legacy of the Fu Manchu-like Ra's al Ghul (Liam Neeson) and his League of Shadows is made manifest in the bulky, masked, braggart form of Bane (Tom Hardy), a seeming anarchist in a sheepskin jacket, and the not-too-concealed presence of a literal offspring of the demon out to pay Bruce/Batman/Gotham back for the villain's failure and death at the end of Batman Begins. Even the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), secondary bad guy in both earlier films, shows up, as a Kafkaesque judge in a topsy-turvy Gotham, sitting atop a mountain of desks with straw poking out of his shoulder, offering cops and businessfolk a brutal choice between death or exile (exile involves a short walk across dangerous ice). The light and dark sides of Gotham City and the hero's personality are reflected by two women who, as the film progresses, inevitably change positions.

Directed by Christopher Nolan. (PG-13. 165 minutes.) There is ambition behind ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Director Christopher Nolan and his collaborators distill everything that has happened in our world in the past four years - everything since ""The Dark Knight"" debuted in 2008 - and render it in nightmare terms. In doing so, they try, in the realm of fantasy, to tap into the fears underlying modern life. In ""The Dark Knight,"" the antecedent was 9/11: The vision of civic chaos and of the unrelenting, unremitting evil embodied by Heath Ledger's the Joker expressed, in popular art, Americans deepest terrors in the first decade of this century. But in the final installment of Nolan's Batman trilogy, the antecedent is the financial crisis, a much more muddled and less dramatic ongoing event. And it makes for a much more muddled and less dramatic movie ... that goes on and on and on. For about half its running time, it's reasonably entertaining, but the other half - inevitably, the second half - is something of a slog. The movie is self-important but with little ultimate importance, and sentimental without much in the way of human feeling. But it has its moments - at 165 minutes it had better - plus Anne Hathaway, enjoyable throughout as the movie's nicely reimagined Catwoman. A central weakness of ""Dark Knight Rises,"" when compared to the other films is the absence of a compelling, complicated villain. In place of Ledger's Joker, we find Tom Hardy as Bane, a bald muscleman with his face and nose covered in a black leather mask. Bane is a formidable presence and as evil as they come, but he has a one-note personality, without humor or nuance. Even worse, with his voice distorted by that mask, he sounds like Scooby-Doo, which means that whenever he speaks for more than a sentence or two, he sounds unintentionally funny, not terrifying. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" takes place eight years after the conclusion of ""The Dark Knight."" Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) walks with a limp and lives in glum seclusion, while Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), though presiding over a peaceful Gotham City, nurses a haunted sense of inner compromise. It's a good time for the dark forces to strike, which they do, though exactly how they strike is a little hard to follow. Dastardly plot Bane's dastardly plot involves a massive transfer of wealth using the stock exchange. It consists further of inciting civil unrest and taking control of cutting-edge technologies that can be used for good or ill. Nolan's critique of Wall Street is implicit in the portrayal of the rapacious and arrogant Wall Street traders, but some uneasiness about the Occupy movement is evident, as well, in the film's depiction of people's tribunals. However, to say that the movie steers a middle course would be to impose coherence on what seems more like a scattered set of fears and impressions. In"
